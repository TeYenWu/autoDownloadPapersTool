{"paperId":2702518,"abstract":"Recent mobile phones integrate fingerprint scanners to authenticate users biometrically and replace passwords, making authentication more convenient for users. However, due to their cost, capacitive fingerprint scanners have been limited to top-of-the-line phones, a result of the required resolution and quality of the sensor. We present Bodyprint, a biometric authentication system that detects users' biometric features using the same type of capacitive sensing, but uses the touchscreen as the image sensor instead. While the input resolution of a touchscreen is ~6 dpi, the surface area is larger, allowing the touch sensor to scan users' body parts, such as ears, fingers, fists, and palms by pressing them against the display. Bodyprint compensates for the low input resolution with an increased false rejection rate, but does not compromise on authentication precision: In our evaluation with 12 participants, Bodyprint classified body parts with 99.98% accuracy and identifies users with 99.52% accuracy with a retry likelihood of 26.82% to prevent false positives, thereby bringing reliable biometric user authentication to a vast number of commodity devices.","citation":[{"content":"Robert Tartz , Ted Gooding, Hand Biometrics Using Capacitive Touchscreens, Adjunct Proceedings of the 28th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software & Technology, November 08-11, 2015, Daegu, Kyungpook, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2815721"},{"content":"Anhong Guo , Robert Xiao , Chris Harrison, CapAuth: Identifying and Differentiating User Handprints on Commodity Capacitive Touchscreens, Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Interactive Tabletops & Surfaces, November 15-18, 2015, Madeira, Portugal","paperID":"2817722"},{"content":"Christian Holz , Marius Knaust, Biometric Touch Sensing: Seamlessly Augmenting Each Touch with Continuous Authentication, Proceedings of the 28th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software & Technology, November 08-11, 2015, Daegu, Kyungpook, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2807458"}],"reference":[{"content":"Abate, A.F., Nappi, M., Riccio, D., Sabatino, G. 2D and 3D face recognition.
