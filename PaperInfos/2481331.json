We performed two user studies with different amounts of dummy cursors and differently colored cursors. The results show that dummy cursors significantly improve security. At the same time, decrease in performance is kept within an acceptable range. Depending on the required degree of security, the studies favor 8 or 16 differently colored cursors as the best trade-off between security and usability.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/6dPbUpbU9MI?rel=0","title":"Using fake cursors to secure on-screen password entry","filename":"CHI13/p2399","authors":["Alexander De Luca","Emanuel von Zezschwitz","Laurent Pichler","Heinrich Hussmann"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
