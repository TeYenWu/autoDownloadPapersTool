We explore three balancing approaches in a dance game and show that the explicit approach commonly used in commercial games reduces self-esteem and feelings of relatedness in dyads, whereas hidden balancing improves self-esteem and reduces score differential without affecting game outcome. We apply our results in a second study with dyads where one player had a mobility disability and used a wheelchair. By making motion-based games accessible for people with different physical abilities, and by enabling people with mobility disabilities to compete on a par with able-bodied peers, we show how to provide empowering experiences through enjoyable games that have the potential to increase physical activity and self-esteem.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xPhspN3l3xg?rel=0","title":"Effects of balancing for physical abilities on player performance, experience and self-esteem in exergames","filename":"CHI14/p2201","authors":["Kathrin Maria Gerling","Matthew Miller","Regan L.
