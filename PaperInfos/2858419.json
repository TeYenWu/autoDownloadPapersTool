We examine how aspects of game player experience are influenced by peak-end manipulations to the sequence of events in games that are otherwise objectively identical. A first experiment examines players' retrospective assessments of two games (a pattern matching game based on Bejeweled and a point-and-click reaction game) when the sequence of difficulty is manipulated to induce positive, negative and neutral peak-end effects. A second experiment examines assessments of a shootout game in which the balance between challenge and skill is similarly manipulated. Results across the games show that recollection of challenge was strongly influenced by peak-end effects; however, results for fun, enjoyment, and preference to repeat were varied -- sometimes significantly in favour of the hypothesized effects, sometimes insignificant, but never against the hypothesis.","title":"Peak-End Effects on Player Experience in Casual Games","filename":"CHI16/p5608","authors":["Carl Gutwin","Christianne Rooke","Andy Cockburn","Regan L.
