Our first study is a lab-based ten-session text entry experiment. In our second study we use a new text entry evaluation methodology based on the experience sampling method (ESM). In the ESM study, participants installed an Android app on their own mobile phones that periodically sampled their text entry performance and user experience amid their everyday activities for four weeks. The studies show that text can be entered at an average speed of 28 to 39 WPM, depending on the method and the user's experience, with 1.0% to 3.6% character error rates remaining. Error rates of touchscreen input, particularly with SGK, are a major challenge; and reducing out-of-vocabulary errors is particularly important. Both SGK and STK have strengths, weaknesses, and different individual awareness and preferences. Two-thumb touch typing in a focused setting is particularly effective on STK, whereas one-handed SGK typing with the thumb is particularly effective in more mobile situations. When exposed to both, users tend to migrate from STK to SGK. We also conclude that studies in the lab and in the wild can both be informative to reveal different aspects of keyboard experience, but used in conjunction is more reliable in comprehensively assessing input technologies of current and future generations.","reference":[{"content":"Xiaojun Bi , Ciprian Chelba , Tom Ouyang , Kurt Partridge , Shumin Zhai, Bimanual gesture keyboard, Proceedings of the 25th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology, October 07-10, 2012, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA","paperID":"2380136"},{"content":"Xiaojun Bi , Tom Ouyang , Shumin Zhai, Both complete and correct?: multi-objective optimization of touchscreen keyboard, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 26-May 01, 2014, Toronto, Ontario, Canada","paperID":"2557414"},{"content":"Steven J.
