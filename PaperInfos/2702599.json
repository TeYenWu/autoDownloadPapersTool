This enables designers to produce dynamic physical forms by \"clipping\" actuators onto screens. ShapeClip displays are portable, scalable, fault-tolerant, and support runtime re-arrangement. Users are not required to have knowledge of electronics or programming, and can develop motion designs with presentation software, image editors, or web-technologies. To evaluate ShapeClip we carried out a full-day workshop with expert designers. Participants were asked to generate shape-changing designs and then construct them using ShapeClip. ShapeClip enabled participants to rapidly and successfully transform their ideas into functional systems.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/FhnSkhxR2uw?rel=0","reference":[{"content":"Jason Alexander , Andrés Lucero , Sriram Subramanian, Tilt displays: designing display surfaces with multi-axis tilting and actuation, Proceedings of the 14th international conference on Human-computer interaction with mobile devices and services, September 21-24, 2012, San Francisco, California, USA","paperID":"2371600"},{"content":"Olivier Bau , Uros Petrevski , Wendy Mackay, BubbleWrap: a textile-based electromagnetic haptic display, CHI '09 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 04-09, 2009, Boston, MA, USA","paperID":"1520542"},{"content":"Bier, E.A., Stone, M.C., Pier, K., Buxton, W., and DeRose, T.D., Toolglass and Magic Lenses: The Seethrough Interface, in SIGGRAPH '93: ACM: p. 7380.","paperID":"None"},{"content":"Christopher N.
