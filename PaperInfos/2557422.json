These interfaces may, in fact, reduce the error rate of specific error classes, but may also have unintended consequences. In this paper, we show a series of studies where a better interface did not reduce the number of errors but instead shifted errors from one error class (omissions) to another error class (perseverations). We also show that having access to progress tracking (a progress bar) does not reduce the number of errors. We propose and demonstrate a solution -- a predictive error system -- that reduces errors based on the error class, not on the type of interface.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ayzTKb3NG0s?rel=0","title":"The law of unintended consequences: the case of external subgoal support","filename":"CHI14/p1767","authors":["J.
