This \"LightCloth\" is woven from diffusive optical fibers. Since the fibers are arranged in parallel, the cloth has one-dimensional position information. Sensor-emitter pairs attached to bundles of contiguous fibers enable bundle-specific light input and output. We developed a prototype system that allows full-color illumination and 8-bit data input by infrared signals. We present as an application a chair with a LightCloth cover whose illumination pattern is specified using an infrared light pen. Here we describe the implementation details of the device and discuss possible interactions using the device.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/N6muTr54JxY?rel=0","title":"LightCloth: senseable illuminating optical fiber cloth for creating interactive surfaces","filename":"CHI13/p603","authors":["Sunao Hashimoto","Ryohei Suzuki","Youichi Kamiyama","Masahiko Inami","Takeo Igarashi"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
