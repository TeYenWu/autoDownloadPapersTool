However, current designs do not take into consideration that touching the interactive surface at different heights is not the same; for body-height displays, the bottom portion of the screen is within easier reach of the foot than the hand. We explore the design space of foot input on vertical surfaces, and propose three distinct interaction modalities: hand, foot tapping, and foot gesturing. Our design exploration pays particular attention to areas of the touch surface that were previously overlooked: out of hand's reach and close to the floor. We instantiate our design space with a working prototype of an interactive surface, in which we are able to distinguish between finger and foot tapping and extend the input area beyond the bottom of the display to support foot gestures.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/x4LvNjPdwok?rel=0","title":"Let's kick it: how to stop wasting the bottom third of your large screen display","filename":"CHI14/p1411","authors":["Ricardo Jota","Pedro Lopes","Daniel Wigdor","Joaquim Jorge"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
