However, tabbed browsing is difficult for mobile web browsers due to the limited screen space and the reduced precision of touch. We present an experiment comparing Safari's pages-based switching interface using horizontal swiping gestures with the stacked cards-based switching interface using vertical scrolling gestures, introduced by Chrome. The results of our experiment show that cards-based switching interface allows for faster switching and is less frustrating, with no significant effect on error rates. We generalize these findings, and provide design implications for mobile information spaces.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mCgn99ulFso?rel=0","title":"Swipe vs. scroll: web page switching on mobile browsers","filename":"CHI13/p2171","authors":["Andrew Warr","Ed H.
