{"paperId":2702143,"abstract":"The accuracy of pedometry varies depending on where an inertial sensor is located on the body. Motivated by the increasing popularity of wearable computing, this paper investigates the accuracy with which pedometry can be achieved on a head-mounted device: something previous research has not investigated. A study with 16 subjects compares the accuracy of pedometry for walking and running with an inertial sensor located at the head, pocket and hand/arm. Our study did not detect a significant difference in step counting accuracy between sensor locations, which demonstrates the feasibility of pedometry-based apps for head-mounted displays.","citation":[],"reference":[{"content":"Bragi The Dash, bragi.com.","paperID":"None"},{"content":"Fitbit wearable activity trackers, fitbit.com.","paperID":"None"},{"content":"Samsung Gear S, samsung.com/gears.","paperID":"None"},{"content":"Amadeo, R.
