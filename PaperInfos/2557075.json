The projection is created behind the upright standing phone and is touch and gesture-enabled. Multiple projections can be merged to create shared spaces for multi-user collaboration. We investigate this new setup, starting with the concept that we evaluated with a concept prototype. Furthermore we present our technical prototype, a mobile phone case with integrated projector that allows for the aforementioned interaction. We discuss its technical requirements and evaluate the accuracy of interaction in a second user study. We conclude with lessons learned and design guidelines.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/r3d7FpLQgKM?rel=0","title":"SurfacePhone: a mobile projection device for single- and multiuser everywhere tabletop interaction","filename":"CHI14/p3513","authors":["Christian Winkler","Markus Löchtefeld","David Dobbelstein","Antonio Krüger","Enrico Rukzio"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
