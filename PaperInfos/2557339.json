Reading outcome is heavily dependent on the level of engagement while reading. In this paper, we present FOCUS, an EEG-augmented reading system which monitors a child's engagement level in real time, and provides contextual BCI training sessions to improve a child's reading engagement. A laboratory experiment was conducted to assess the validity of the system. Results showed that FOCUS could significantly improve engagement in terms of both EEG-based measurement and teachers' subjective measure on the reading outcome.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ydlAKS-WlqU?rel=0","title":"FOCUS: enhancing children's engagement in reading by using contextual BCI training sessions","filename":"CHI14/p1905","authors":["Jin Huang","Chun Yu","Yuntao Wang","Yuhang Zhao","Siqi Liu","Chou Mo","Jie Liu","Lie Zhang","Yuanchun Shi"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
