Our goal is to inform policy and the design of future Internet architecture and applications. We interviewed 44 people from America, Asia, Europe, and Africa who had sought anonymity and asked them about their experiences. A key finding of our research is the very large variation in interviewees' past experiences and life situations leading them to seek anonymity, and how they tried to achieve it. Our results suggest implications for the design of online communities, challenges for policy, and ways to improve anonymity tools and educate users about the different routes and threats to anonymity on the Internet.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/a-0RBySjuSk?rel=0","title":"Why do people seek anonymity on the internet?: informing policy and design","filename":"CHI13/p2657","authors":["Ruogu Kang","Stephanie Brown","Sara Kiesler"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
