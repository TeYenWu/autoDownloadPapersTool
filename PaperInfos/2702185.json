In this work, we use this grip change as a continuous information stream for detecting where the user will touch while their finger is still en-route. We refer to this as in the air prediction. We show that grip change detected using standard mobile motion sensors produces similar in the air touch point predictions to techniques that use auxiliary sensor arrays, even in varying physical scenarios such as interacting in a moving vehicle. Finally, our model that combines grip change and the resulting touch point predicted where users intended to land, lowering error rates by 41%.","reference":[{"content":"Shiri Azenkot , Shumin Zhai, Touch behavior with different postures on soft smartphone keyboards, Proceedings of the 14th international conference on Human-computer interaction with mobile devices and services, September 21-24, 2012, San Francisco, California, USA","paperID":"2371612"},{"content":"Joanna Bergstrom-Lehtovirta , Antti Oulasvirta, Modeling the functional area of the thumb on mobile touchscreen surfaces, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 26-May 01, 2014, Toronto, Ontario, Canada","paperID":"2557354"},{"content":"Mayank Goel , Leah Findlater , Jacob Wobbrock, WalkType: using accelerometer data to accomodate situational impairments in mobile touch screen text entry, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, May 05-10, 2012, Austin, Texas, USA","paperID":"2208662"},{"content":"Mayank Goel , Alex Jansen , Travis Mandel , Shwetak N.
