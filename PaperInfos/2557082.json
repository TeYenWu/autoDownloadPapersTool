A comparison was made with a standard video player (YouTube) in two scenarios with two classes of users: revision students and independent learners. Results showed that users of Panopticon were significantly faster at finding information within the lecture videos than users of the YouTube player. It was also found that videos predominantly featuring a talking lecturer took longest to navigate, presenting design implications for lectures to be uploaded to open eLearning platforms.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/TWT7nNNSjx4?rel=0","title":"Panopticon as an eLearning support search tool","filename":"CHI14/p1221","authors":["James Nicholson","Mark Huber","Daniel Jackson","Patrick Olivier"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
