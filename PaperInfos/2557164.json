Yet in busy and noisy environments, or when the user is physically active, these channels sometimes fail. Recent work has explored the use of physical shape-change as an additional method for conveying notifications when the device is in-hand or viewable. However, we do not yet understand the effectiveness of physical shape-change as a method for communicating in-pocket notifications. This paper presents three robustly implemented, mobile-device sized shape-changing devices, and two user studies to evaluate their effectiveness at conveying notifications. The studies reveal that (1) different types and configurations of shape-change convey different levels of urgency and; (2) fast pulsing shape-changing notifications are missed less often and recognised more quickly than the standard slower vibration pulse rates of a mobile device.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mn5cOmIkpCY?rel=0","title":"Evaluating the effectiveness of physical shape-change for in-pocket mobile device notifications","filename":"CHI14/p2589","authors":["Panteleimon Dimitriadis","Jason Alexander"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
