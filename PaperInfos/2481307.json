Casual interactions are particularly appropriate in scenarios where full engagement with devices is frowned upon socially, is unsafe, physically challenging or too mentally taxing. Novel sensing approaches which go beyond direct touch enable wider use of casual interactions, which will often be 'around device' interactions. We consider the degree to which previous commercial products and research prototypes can be considered as fitting the focused-casual framework, and describe the properties using control theoretic concepts. In an experimental study we observe that users naturally apply more precise and more highly engaged interaction techniques when faced with a more challenging task and use more relaxed gestures in easier tasks.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/dzydPAfotTQ?rel=0","title":"Focused and casual interactions: allowing users to vary their level of engagement","filename":"CHI13/p2223","authors":["Henning Pohl","Roderick Murray-Smith"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
