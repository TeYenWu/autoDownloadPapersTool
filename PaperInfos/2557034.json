Through a process of iterative design in collaboration with library staff and children's writers we designed DoHS to support the potential for playful storytelling through interactions with books. A deployment of DoHS with two classes of 8 to 10 years olds as part of their regular library visits revealed insights related to how to balance the expectations of a child-at-play and the requirement to further develop their creative reading and writing skills. Based on our experiences we recommend that designers create playful digitally based activities that encourage children to explore libraries and experience new interactions with physical books.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/s1cIu0u8l-Y?rel=0","citation":[{"content":"Simon Robinson , Jennifer Pearson , Matt Jones, Q-arrgh!: Commandeering Everyday Digital Codes, Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services, August 24-27, 2015, Copenhagen, Denmark","paperID":"2785855"},{"content":"Gavin Wood, Using play as a lens to bridge the physical with the digital, Proceedings of the first ACM SIGCHI annual symposium on Computer-human interaction in play, October 19-21, 2014, Toronto, Ontario, Canada","paperID":"2659012"},{"content":"Jennifer Pearson , Simon Robinson , Matt Jones, PaperChains: Dynamic Sketch+Voice Annotations, Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing, March 14-18, 2015, Vancouver, BC, Canada","paperID":"2675138"}],"title":"The department of hidden stories: Playful digital storytelling for children in a public library","filename":"CHI14/p1885","authors":["Gavin Wood","John Vines","Madeline Balaam","Nick Taylor","Thomas Smith","Clara Crivellaro","Juliana Mensah","Helen Limon","John Challis","Linda Anderson","Adam Clarke","Peter C.
