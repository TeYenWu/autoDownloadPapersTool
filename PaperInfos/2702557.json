{"paperId":2702557,"abstract":"Social media sites are increasingly adopted by small nonprofit organizations (NPOs) to help them meet their public engagement goals. However, several characteristics of small organizations make it hard for them to effectively use social media sites. We present findings from interviews with 26 small NPOs' social media professionals on how they use multiple social media sites to support public engagement. Small NPOs use multiple social media sites to engage with different stakeholders toward various ends. However, these NPOs are not using social media to its full potential with regard to community-building and action mobilization. Several challenges in small NPOs, such as ineffective measurement of social media performance, deficient organizational resources, and lack of control over work, lead to strong tensions between social media engagement strategies and outcomes. Drawing on these findings, we present several practical implications for the design of successful public engagement social media tools.","citation":[{"content":"Youyang Hou, Understand the Design and Implementation of Civic Technologies in Public Organizations, Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing Companion, February 26-March 02, 2016, San Francisco, California, USA","paperID":"2874353"},{"content":"Sheena Erete , Emily Ryou , Geoff Smith , Khristina Marie Fassett , Sarah Duda, Storytelling with Data: Examining the Use of Data by Non-Profit Organizations, Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing, February 27-March 02, 2016, San Francisco, California, USA","paperID":"2820068"}],"reference":[{"content":"Anduiza, E., Cristancho, C. and Sabucedo, J.
