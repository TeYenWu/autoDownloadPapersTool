With the proposed technology, sound reproduction can easily be integrated into vari-ous objects at the design stage and little assembly is required. The speaker can take the shape of anything from an abstract spiral to a rubber duck, opening new opportunities in product design. Furthermore, both audible sound and inaudible ultrasound can be produced with the same design, allowing for identifying and tracking 3D printed objects in space using common integrated microphones. The design of 3D printed speakers is based on electrostatic loudspeaker technology first explored in the early 1930s but not broadly applied until now. These speakers are simpler than common electromagnetic speakers, while allowing for sound reproduction at 60 dB levels with arbitrary directivity ranging from focused to omnidirectional. Our research of 3D printed speakers contributes to the growing body of work exploring functional 3D printing in interactive applications.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/TxsyPdTdW5A?rel=0","title":"3D printed interactive speakers","filename":"CHI14/p1733","authors":["Yoshio Ishiguro","Ivan Poupyrev"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
