The only change to the interface is how the background image is presented to the user in the password creation phase--we call the effect of this change the \"presentation effect\". We demonstrate the presentation effect by performing a comparative user study of two groups using the same background image, where the image is presented in two different ways prior to password creation. Our results show a statistically different distribution of user's graphical passwords, with no observed usability consequences.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/8E753o5u75Y?rel=0","title":"The presentation effect on graphical passwords","filename":"CHI14/p2947","authors":["Julie Thorpe","Muath Al-Badawi","Brent MacRae","Amirali Salehi-Abari"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
