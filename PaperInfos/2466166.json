The absence of visual feedback led participants to deeply focus on the movement of their bodies, and to have a different awareness of their bodies and the space around them. The notable difference between performing this interaction in light and dark suggests that non-visual based interfaces are a fruitful area to explore in somaesthetic interaction.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/2cZEj6MW1mQ?rel=0","title":"Bodily interaction in the dark","filename":"CHI13/p1275","authors":["Linden Vongsathorn","Kenton O'Hara","Helena M.
