In contrast, we argue that selectively concealing whose movement controls which representation can facilitate engaging play experiences. We call this \"innominate movement representation\" and explore this opportunity through our game \"i-dentity\", where players have to guess who makes everyone's controller light up based on his/her movements. Our work reveals five dimensions for the design of innominate movement representation: concealing the association between movement and representation; number of represented movements; number of players with representations; location of representation in relation to the body and technical attributes of representation. We also present five strategies for how innominate representation can be embedded into a play experience. With our work we hope to expand the range of digital movement games.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/tj4Ci2wsCZE?rel=0","title":"i-dentity: innominate movement representation as engaging game element","filename":"CHI14/p2181","authors":["Jayden Garner","Gavin Wood","Sebastiaan Pijnappel","Martin Murer","Florian Mueller"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
