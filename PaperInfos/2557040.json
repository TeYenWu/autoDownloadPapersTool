We conducted a study of combining gaze gestures with vibrotactile feedback. Gaze gestures were used as an input method in a mobile device and vibrotactile feedback as a new alternative way to give confirmation of interaction events. Our results show that vibrotactile feedback significantly improved the use of gaze gestures. The tasks were completed faster and rated easier and more comfortable when vibrotactile feedback was provided.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/EuqMC1KznhM?rel=0","title":"Gaze gestures and haptic feedback in mobile devices","filename":"CHI14/p435","authors":["Jari Kangas","Deepak Akkil","Jussi Rantala","Poika Isokoski","Päivi Majaranta","Roope Raisamo"],"conference":"CHI '14","reference":[{"content":"Stephen Brewster , Faraz Chohan , Lorna Brown, Tactile feedback for mobile interactions, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 28-May 03, 2007, San Jose, California, USA","paperID":"1240649"},{"content":"Heiko Drewes , Alexander De Luca , Albrecht Schmidt, Eye-gaze interaction for mobile phones, Proceedings of the 4th international conference on mobile technology, applications, and systems and the 1st international symposium on Computer human interaction in mobile technology, September 10-12, 2007, Singapore","paperID":"1378122"},{"content":"Heiko Drewes , Albrecht Schmidt, Interacting with the computer using gaze gestures, Proceedings of the 11th IFIP TC 13 international conference on Human-computer interaction, September 10-14, 2007, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","paperID":"1778385"},{"content":"Morten Lund Dybdal , Javier San Agustin , John Paulin Hansen, Gaze input for mobile devices by dwell and gestures, Proceedings of the Symposium on Eye Tracking Research and Applications, March 28-30, 2012, Santa Barbara, California","paperID":"2168601"},{"content":"Henna Heikkilä , Kari-Jouko Räihä, Simple gaze gestures and the closure of the eyes as an interaction technique, Proceedings of the Symposium on Eye Tracking Research and Applications, March 28-30, 2012, Santa Barbara, California","paperID":"2168579"},{"content":"Eve Hoggan , Stephen A.
