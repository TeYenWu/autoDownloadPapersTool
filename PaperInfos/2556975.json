{"paperId":2556975,"abstract":"How do people keep track of their money? In this paper we present a preliminary scoping study of how 14 individuals in the San Francisco Bay Area earn, save, spend and understand money and their personal and family finances. We describe the practices we developed for exploring the sensitive topic of money, and then discuss three sets of findings. The first is the emotional component of the relationship people have with their finances. Second, we discuss the tools and processes people used to keep track of their financial situation. Finally we discuss how people account for the unknown and unpredictable nature of the future through their financial decisions. We conclude by discussing the future of studies of money and finance in HCI, and reflect on the opportunities for improving tools to aid people in managing and planning their finances.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/tq7VNlIpyg0?rel=0","citation":[{"content":"Dhaval Vyas , Stephen Snow , Margot Brereton , Uwe Dulleck , Xavier Boyen, Being Thrifty on a $100K Wage: Austerity in Family Finances, Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference Companion on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing, March 14-18, 2015, Vancouver, BC, Canada","paperID":"2698998"},{"content":"Ping-Jing Yang , Xianghua Ding, Today's Life Style and Yesterday's Life Experience: A Study of Financial Practices of Retirees In China, Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing Companion, February 26-March 02, 2016, San Francisco, California, USA","paperID":"2869084"},{"content":"Stephen Snow , Dhaval Vyas, Fixing the Alignment: An Exploration of Budgeting Practices in the Home, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 18-23, 2015, Seoul, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2732808"},{"content":"Stephen Snow , Dhaval Vyas, Fostering Collaboration in the Management of Family Finances, Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Australian Special Interest Group for Computer Human Interaction, December 07-10, 2015, Parkville, VIC, Australia","paperID":"2838746"},{"content":"Junius Gunaratne , Oded Nov, Informing and Improving Retirement Saving Performance using Behavioral Economics Theory-driven User Interfaces, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 18-23, 2015, Seoul, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2702408"},{"content":"Susanna Heyman, Online Investment Advisors and Novice Users, Proceedings of the European Conference on Cognitive Ergonomics 2015, July 01-03, 2015, Warsaw, Poland","paperID":"2788437"},{"content":"Gary Pritchard , John Vines , Patrick Olivier, Your Money's No Good Here: The Elimination of Cash Payment on London Buses, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 18-23, 2015, Seoul, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2702137"},{"content":"Dhaval Vyas , Stephen Snow , Paul Roe , Margot Brereton, Social Organization of Household Finance: Understanding Artful Financial Systems in the Home, Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing, February 27-March 02, 2016, San Francisco, California, USA","paperID":"2819937"},{"content":"Daniel A.
