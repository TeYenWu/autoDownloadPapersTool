Results suggest that individuals' values can predict their topical interests. For example, holding stronger universalism values predict interests towards environmental articles, whereas holding stronger achievement values predict interest towards work-related articles. Findings demonstrate the possibility of targeting based on individuals' personal values, but also highlight certain challenges and limitations when applying this approach for online content.","citation":[],"title":"You read what you value: understanding personal values and reading interests","filename":"CHI14/p983","authors":["Gary Hsieh","Jilin Chen","Jalal U.
