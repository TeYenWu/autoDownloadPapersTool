Activists organize weekly demonstrations against Israel's settlement policy and the separation wall. Over a period of 28 months, we conducted a field study consisting of eight days 'on the ground' observation and interviewing, and extensive monitoring of Internet communication. We describe the activists' background and their efforts to organize these demonstrations under conditions of military occupation. Over time, we observe the role both digital and material factors play in the organization of protest. Specifically, we analyze how Email and Facebook were appropriated to facilitate interaction 'on the ground'.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/cFD56uE9ZjM?rel=0","title":"Fighting against the wall: social media use by political activists in a Palestinian village","filename":"CHI13/p1979","authors":["Volker Wulf","Konstantin Aal","Ibrahim Abu Kteish","Meryem Atam","Kai Schubert","Markus Rohde","George P.
