Specifically, this paper presents an interface that displays personal web browsing data. The interface aims to reveal underlying infrastructure using several methods: drawing attention to the scope of mined data by displaying deliberately selected sensitive data, using purposeful malfunction as a way to encourage reverse engineering, and challenging normative expectations around data mining by displaying information in unconventional ways. Qualitative results from a two-week deployment show that these strategies can raise people's awareness about data mining, promote efficacy and control over personal data, and inspire reflection on the goals and assumptions embedded in infrastructures for personal data analytics.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/SwjQOJdPbj4?rel=0","title":"\"Everybody knows what you're doing\": a critical design approach to personal informatics","filename":"CHI13/p3403","authors":["Vera Khovanskaya","Eric P.S.
