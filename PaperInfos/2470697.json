We conducted a user study to record eye movements of four participants over a full day of their daily life, totalling 42.5 hours of eye movement data. Participants were asked to self-annotate four non-mutually exclusive cues: social (interacting with somebody vs. no interaction), cognitive (concentrated work vs. leisure), physical (physically active vs. not active), and spatial (inside vs. outside a building). We evaluate a proof-of-concept EyeContext system that combines encoding of eye movements into strings and a spectrum string kernel support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Our results demonstrate the large information content available in long-term human visual behaviour and opens up new venues for research on eye-based behavioural monitoring and life logging.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/c7LzXTgMIHY?rel=0","title":"EyeContext: recognition of high-level contextual cues from human visual behaviour","filename":"CHI13/p305","authors":["Andreas Bulling","Christian Weichel","Hans Gellersen"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
