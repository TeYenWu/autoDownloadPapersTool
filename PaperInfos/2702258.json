{"paperId":2702258,"abstract":"We present our findings from a mixed methods study of mobile phone practices of rural Indian women. We situate our study in the context of Projecting Health, a public health initiative we deployed in Uttar Pradesh (India) to target the dissemination of health information for mothers and newborns. Adopting the lens of feminist reflexivity, we reconsider our design of Projecting Health by factoring in the mobile media consumption and sharing practices of our target audience. We stress the importance of taking a community-oriented approach and show that although there are strict social conventions and patriarchal norms that constrain various practices of these women, they are able to exercise agency and mobilize help within their communities when needed.","reference":[{"content":"Mara Balestrini , Jon Bird , Paul Marshall , Alberto Zaro , Yvonne Rogers, Understanding sustained community engagement: a case study in heritage preservation in rural argentina, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 26-May 01, 2014, Toronto, Ontario, Canada","paperID":"2557323"},{"content":"Shaowen Bardzell, Feminist HCI: taking stock and outlining an agenda for design, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 10-15, 2010, Atlanta, Georgia, USA","paperID":"1753521"},{"content":"Shaowen Bardzell , Jeffrey Bardzell, Towards a feminist HCI methodology: social science, feminism, and HCI, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, May 07-12, 2011, Vancouver, BC, Canada","paperID":"1979041"},{"content":"Nicola J.
