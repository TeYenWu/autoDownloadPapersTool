Through a web-based survey study of 75 adolescents in the US, we develop and empirically validate a theoretical model of adolescent resilience in the presence of online risks. We show evidence that resilience is a key factor in protecting teens from experiencing online risks, even when teens exhibit high levels of Internet addiction. Resilience also neutralizes the negative psychological effects associated with Internet addiction and online risk exposure. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of design solutions that foster teen resilience and strength building, as opposed to solutions targeted toward parents that often focus on restriction and risk prevention.","title":"Resilience Mitigates the Negative Effects of Adolescent Internet Addiction and Online Risk Exposure","filename":"CHI15/p4029","authors":["Pamela Wisniewski","Haiyan Jia","Na Wang","Saijing Zheng","Heng Xu","Mary Beth Rosson","John M.
