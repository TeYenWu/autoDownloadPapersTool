{"paperId":2702439,"abstract":"Edge targets, such as buttons or menus along the edge of a screen, are known to afford fast acquisition performance in desktop mousing environments. As the popularity of touch-based devices continues to grow, understanding the affordances of edge targets on touchscreen is needed. This paper describes results from two controlled experiments that examine in detail the effect of edge targets on performance in touch devices. The results show that on touch devices, a target's proximity to the edge may have a significant negative effect on reaction time. We examine the effect in detail and explore mitigating factors. We discuss potential explanations for the effect and propose implications for the design of efficient interfaces for touch devices.","citation":[],"reference":[{"content":"Johnny Accot , Shumin Zhai, More than dotting the i's --- foundations for crossing-based interfaces, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 20-25, 2002, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","paperID":"503390"},{"content":"Johnny Accot , Shumin Zhai, Refining Fitts' law models for bivariate pointing, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 05-10, 2003, Ft.
