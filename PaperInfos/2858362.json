We found origami designs are often characterized by pre-synthesized patterns and automated algorithms. Furthermore, augmenting articulated features to a desired model requires time-consuming synthesis of interconnected joints. This paper presents CardBoardiZer, a rapid cardboard based prototyping platform that allows everyday sculptural 3D models to be easily customized, articulated and folded. We develop a building platform to allow the designer to 1) import a desired 3D shape, 2) customize articulated partitions into planar or volumetric foldable patterns, and 3) define rotational movements between partitions. The system unfolds the model into 2D crease-cut-slot patterns ready for die-cutting and folding. In this paper, we developed interactive algorithms and validated the usability of CardBoardiZer using various 3D models. Furthermore, comparisons between CardBoardiZer and methods of AutodeskÂ® 123D Make, demonstrated significantly shorter time-to-prototype and ease of fabrication.","title":"CardBoardiZer: Creatively Customize, Articulate and Fold 3D Mesh Models","filename":"CHI16/p897","authors":["Yunbo Zhang","Wei Gao","Luis Paredes","Karthik Ramani"],"conference":"CHI '16"}
