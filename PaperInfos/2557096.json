However, the human finger has considerably large fingertip size and finger input is imprecise. As such, acquiring small targets on a touch screen is still a challenging task. In this paper, we present the LinearDragger, a new and integrated one-finger target acquisition technique for small and clustered targets. The proposed method has three advantages. First, it allows users to select targets in dense clustered groups easily with a single touch-drag-release operation. Second, it maps the 2D selection problem into a more precise 1D selection problem, which is independent of the target distribution. Third, it avoids finger occlusion and does not create visual distraction. As a result, it is particularly suitable for applications with dense targets and rich visual elements. Results of our controlled experiments show that when selecting small targets, LinearDragger takes about 70% and 30% less selection time than target acquisition without using any techniques and with the state-of-the-art target acquisition technique that involves a single touch operation, respectively, while maintaining a reasonable error rate.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/aKoYPXjl2do?rel=0","title":"LinearDragger: a Linear Selector for One-finger Target Acquisition","filename":"CHI14/p2607","authors":["Oscar Kin-Chung Au","Xiaojun Su","Rynson W.H.
