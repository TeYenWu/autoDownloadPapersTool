We derive a quadratic formula by analyzing the kinematics of the gripping hand. Model fit is high for the thumb-motion trajectories of 20 participants. The model predicts the functional area for a given 1) surface size, 2) hand size, and 3) position of the index finger on the back of the device. Designers can use this model to ensure that a user interface is suitable for interaction with the thumb. The model can also be used inversely - that is, to infer the grips assumed by a given user interface layout.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Xryn9jC6wfc?rel=0","title":"Modeling the functional area of the thumb on mobile touchscreen surfaces","filename":"CHI14/p1991","authors":["Joanna Bergstrom-Lehtovirta","Antti Oulasvirta"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
