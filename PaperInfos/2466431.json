Dynamic data introduce challenges for these interfaces, however, as moving objects may exit the detail view, as well as a person's field of view if they are working at a large interactive surface. To address this \"off-view\" problem, we propose a new information visualization technique, called Canyon. This technique attaches a small view of an off-view object, including some surrounding context, to the external boundary of the detail view. The area between the detail view and the region containing the off-view object is virtually \"folded\" to conserve space. A comparison study was conducted contrasting the benefits and limitations of Canyon to an established technique, called Wedge. Canyon was more accurate across a number of tasks, especially more complex tasks, and was comparably efficient.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/dt4eRz34KYk?rel=0","title":"Canyon: providing location awareness of multiple moving objects in a detail view on large displays","filename":"CHI13/p3149","authors":["Alexandra Ion","Y.-L.
