Yet, although location information is often automatically appended to media, little is know about how users consider location in its creation and viewing. Using Graffiti as a design meme, we developed a novel social media service to investigate these issues. A two week field study showed how users incorporated both utilitarian and playful aspects of location into their social media creation, as well as revealing a disconnect between the location-media relationship intended by creators and perceived by viewers. We outline implications of our work for services that seek to repurpose existing geo-tagged social media in the design of novel services.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/d5FtFtWZ2vc?rel=0","title":"Studying digital graffiti as a location-based social network","filename":"CHI14/p3269","authors":["David K.
