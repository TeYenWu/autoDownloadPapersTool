{"paperId":2470745,"abstract":"The ubiquity of smartphones has led to the emergence of mobile crowdsourcing markets, where smartphone users participate to perform tasks in the physical world. Mobile crowdsourcing markets are uniquely different from their online counterparts in that they require spatial mobility, and are therefore impacted by geographic factors and constraints that are not present in the online case. Despite the emergence and importance of such mobile marketplaces, little to none is known about the labor dynamics and mobility patterns of agents. This paper provides an in-depth exploration of labor dynamics in mobile task markets based on a year-long dataset from a leading mobile crowdsourcing platform. We find that a small core group of workers (< 10%) account for a disproportionately large proportion of activity (> 80%) generated in the market. We find that these super agents are more efficient than other agents across several dimensions: a) they are willing to move longer distances to perform tasks, yet they amortize travel across more tasks, b) they work and search for tasks more efficiently, c) they have higher data quality in terms of accepted submissions, and d) they improve in almost all of these efficiency measures over time. We find that super agent efficiency stems from two simple optimizations --- they are 3x more likely than other agents to chain tasks and they pick fewer lower priced tasks than other agents. We compare mobile and online micro-task markets, and discuss differences in demographics, data quality, and time of use, as well as similarities in super agent behavior. We conclude with a discussion of how a mobile micro-task market might leverage some of our results to improve performance.","citation":[{"content":"Cen Chen , Shih-Fen Cheng , Archan Misra , Hoong Chuin Lau, Multi-Agent Task Assignment for Mobile Crowdsourcing under Trajectory Uncertainties, Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, May 04-08, 2015, Istanbul, Turkey","paperID":"2773400"},{"content":"Yongsung Kim, Libero: On-the-go Crowdsourcing for Package Delivery, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 18-23, 2015, Seoul, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2726964"},{"content":"Cen Chen , Shih-Fen Cheng , Hoong Chuin Lau , Archan Misra, Towards city-scale mobile crowdsourcing: task recommendations under trajectory uncertainties, Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, p.1113-1119, July 25-31, 2015, Buenos Aires, Argentina","paperID":"2832403"},{"content":"Emily Harburg , Yongsung Kim , Elizabeth Gerber , Haoqi Zhang, CrowdFound: A Mobile Crowdsourcing System to Find Lost Items On-the-Go, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 18-23, 2015, Seoul, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2732757"},{"content":"Hung Dang , Tuan Nguyen , Hien To, Maximum Complex Task Assignment: Towards Tasks Correlation in Spatial Crowdsourcing, Proceedings of International Conference on Information Integration and Web-based Applications & Services, December 02-04, 2013, Vienna, Austria","paperID":"2539243"},{"content":"André Sales Fonteles , Sylvain Bouveret , Jérôme Gensel, Heuristics for Task Recommendation in Spatiotemporal Crowdsourcing Systems, Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Advances in Mobile Computing and Multimedia, December 11-13, 2015, Brussels, Belgium","paperID":"2837181"},{"content":"Thivya Kandappu , Archan Misra , Shih-Fen Cheng , Nikita Jaiman , Randy Tandriansyah , Cen Chen , Hoong Chuin Lau , Deepthi Chander , Koustuv Dasgupta, Campus-Scale Mobile Crowd-Tasking: Deployment & Behavioral Insights, Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing, February 27-March 02, 2016, San Francisco, California, USA","paperID":"2819995"},{"content":"Zhuo Chen , Wenlu Hu , Kiryong Ha , Jan Harkes , Benjamin Gilbert , Jason Hong , Asim Smailagic , Dan Siewiorek , Mahadev Satyanarayanan, QuiltView: a crowd-sourced video response system, Proceedings of the 15th Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications, p.1-6, February 26-27, 2014, Santa Barbara, California","paperID":"2565589"},{"content":"Vincenzo Della Mea , Eddy Maddalena , Stefano Mizzaro, Mobile crowdsourcing: four experiments on platforms and tasks, Distributed and Parallel Databases, v.33 n.1, p.123-141, March     2015","paperID":"2735899"},{"content":"Robin Wentao Ouyang , Mani Srivastava , Alice Toniolo , Timothy J.
