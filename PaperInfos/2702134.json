We conduct a controlled experiment using a laptop trackpad where the effect of clutching on pointing performance is dissociated from the effects of control-to-display transfer functions. Participants performed a series of target acquisition tasks using typical cursor acceleration functions with and without clutching. All pointing tasks were feasible without clutching, but clutch-less movements were harder to perform, caused more errors, required more preparation time, and were not faster than clutch-enabled movements.","title":"Clutching Is Not (Necessarily) the Enemy","filename":"CHI15/p4199","authors":["Mathieu Nancel","Daniel Vogel","Edward Lank"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
