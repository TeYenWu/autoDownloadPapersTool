However, when PD is applied to real projects, certain compromises are unavoidable, no matter what stakeholders are involved. With this paper we want to shed light on some of the challenges in implementing \"true\" PD in the case of designing with children, in particular children with severe disabilities. We do this work to better understand challenges in an ongoing project, RHYME, and by doing so we hope to provide insight and inspiration for others.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4zNFvSd5OQg?rel=0","title":"Three tensions in participatory design for inclusion","filename":"CHI13/p2903","authors":["Harald Holone","Jo Herstad"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
