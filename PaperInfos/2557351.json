This study proposes a systematic approach for exploring a large number of strategies using a computer-cluster-based parallelized modeling system. The paper demonstrates the efficacy of the approach for investigating and revealing the effects of different microstrategies on human performance, both within and across individuals, for a time-pressured multimodal dual task. The modeling results suggest that multitasking performance is not simply a matter of interleaving cognitive and sensorimotor processing but is instead heavily influenced by the selection of subtask microstrategies.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/dne6J3sArOM?rel=0","title":"Understanding multitasking through parallelized strategy exploration and individualized cognitive modeling","filename":"CHI14/p3885","authors":["Yunfeng Zhang","Anthony J.
