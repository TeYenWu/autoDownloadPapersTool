In this note, we propose a quantitative measure called Binocular Selectability Discriminant (BSD) to predict the ability of the user to perform selection task in such a setup. In addition, we propose a technique called Binocular Cursor (BC) which takes advantage of this duplicating and overlapping phenomenon, rather than being hampered by it, to resolve binocular selection ambiguity by visualizing the correct selection point. An experiment shows that selection with BC is not slower than monocular selection, and that it can be significantly more precise, depending on the design of BC.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Bm5T4QLuzlA?rel=0","title":"Binocular cursor: enabling selection on transparent displays troubled by binocular parallax","filename":"CHI13/p3169","authors":["Joon Hyub Lee","Seok-Hyung Bae"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
