However, measuring stress non-invasively and continuously at work remains an open challenge. This work explores the possibility of using a pressure-sensitive keyboard and a capacitive mouse to discriminate between stressful and relaxed conditions in a laboratory study. During a 30 minute session, 24 participants performed several computerized tasks consisting of expressive writing, text transcription, and mouse clicking. During the stressful conditions, the large majority of the participants showed significantly increased typing pressure (>79% of the participants) and more contact with the surface of the mouse (75% of the participants). We discuss the potential implications of this work and provide recommendations for future work.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/N_THSc8yI0k?rel=0","title":"Under pressure: sensing stress of computer users","filename":"CHI14/p51","authors":["Javier Hernandez","Pablo Paredes","Asta Roseway","Mary Czerwinski"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
