{"paperId":2481379,"abstract":"One consequence of rapid advances in computer technology is the obsolescence of hundreds of millions of computers each year. This paper explores strategies for increasing the reuse of outdated computers through an investigation of an 8-bit home computer that is still popular in developing countries. We observed the use of the computers in 16 households in Ahmedabad and Bangalore, India in order to gain insight into the contextual factors that support the continued popularity of the device. While most computers become obsolete in less than a decade, this 30-year-old computer technology remains useful because it provides exciting, multi-user family entertainment. While having minimal processing power and virtually no connectivity, the 8-bit computer supports input and output channels that are especially suited for co-located social game play. In contrast, PCs are primarily designed for individual use. Therefore, we offer low-cost design recommendations that would enable outdated PCs to support greater shared use and increased utility within the constrained material context of low-income households. These simple interventions, if adopted by computer refurbishment industries, have the potential to significantly extend the useful lifespan of PCs.","citation":[{"content":"Marcus Carter , John Downs , Bjorn Nansen , Mitchell Harrop , Martin Gibbs, Paradigms of games research in HCI: a review of 10 years of research at CHI, Proceedings of the first ACM SIGCHI annual symposium on Computer-human interaction in play, October 19-21, 2014, Toronto, Ontario, Canada","paperID":"2658708"},{"content":"John Harvey , David Golightly , Andrew Smith, HCI as a means to prosociality in the economy, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 26-May 01, 2014, Toronto, Ontario, Canada","paperID":"2557367"}],"reference":[{"content":"Ali, M. and Bailur, S.
