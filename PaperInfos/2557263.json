However, it remains challenging for developers to create gestures for their applications. This paper studies unistroke gestures, an important category of gestures defined by their single-stroke trajectories. We present Gesture Script, a tool for creating unistroke gesture recognizers. Gesture Script enhances example-based learning with interactive declarative guidance through rendering scripts and interactively trained parts. The structural information from the rendering scripts allows Gesture Script to synthesize gesture variations and generate a more accurate recognizer that also automatically extracts gesture attributes needed by applications. The results of our study with developers show that Gesture Script preserves the threshold of familiar example based gesture tools, while raising the ceiling of the recognizers created in such tools.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/8LvFckFIKyM?rel=0","title":"Gesture script: recognizing gestures and their structure using rendering scripts and interactively trained parts","filename":"CHI14/p1685","authors":["Hao Lü","James A.
