Our device does not require any configuration and is intended for the development of wearable and tangible systems. Our approach allows a bi-directional power flow without any change in the circuit, such that the same circuit can be used for charging and discharging a battery. The contribution of this work is an enabling technology for researchers and practitioners in the fields of Wearable Electronics, Ubiquitous Computing and Human-Computer Interaction interested in exploring new interactions powered by watt-range inductive links. It enables smaller battery sizes, and therefore lighter devices, as the power can be distributed in a way that has not been feasible before. We discuss the motivations, technical details and the workshop evaluating our inductive approach.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/pJ_NCAQy_PY?rel=0","title":"OJAS: open source bi-directional inductive power link","filename":"CHI14/p1049","authors":["Jussi Mikkonen","Ramyah Gowrishankar","Miia Oksanen","Harri Raittinen","Arto Kolinummi"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
