We crafted a trajectory through each sculpture, combining textual and audio instructions to drive directed viewing, movement and touching while listening to accompanying music. We designed key transitions along the way to oscillate between moments of social interaction and isolated personal engagement, and to deliver official interpretation only after visitors had been given the opportunity to make their own. We describe how visitors generally followed our trajectory, engaging with sculptures and making interpretations that sometimes challenged the received interpretation. We relate our findings to discussions of sense-making and design for multiple interpretations, concluding that curators and designers may benefit from considering \\'18trajectories of interpretation'.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/eez2kfjVQBk?rel=0","title":"see me, feel me, touch me, hear me: trajectories and interpretation in a sculpture garden","filename":"CHI13/p149","authors":["Lesley Fosh","Steve Benford","Stuart Reeves","Boriana Koleva","Patrick Brundell"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
