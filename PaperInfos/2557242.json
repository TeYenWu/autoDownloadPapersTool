ACCD reduces the number of explicit viewpoint manipulations by combining self-occlusion management and automated camera control. As such it enables drawing on occluded faces but also around a 3D shape while keeping a constant drawing precision. Our experimental results indicates the efficacy of ACCD over conventional techniques.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/PO_ejMx_6Ow?rel=0","title":"Direct drawing on 3D shapes with automated camera control","filename":"CHI14/p2047","authors":["Michaël Ortega","Thomas Vincent"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
