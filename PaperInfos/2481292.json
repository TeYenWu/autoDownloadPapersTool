We conducted an online survey to better understand the challenges faced by people with visual impairments in sharing and organizing photos, and reviewed existing tools and their limitations. Based on our analysis, we developed an accessible mobile application that enables a visually impaired user to capture photos along with audio recordings for the ambient sound and memo description and to browse through them eyes-free. Five visually impaired participants took part in a study in which they used our app to take photographs in naturalistic settings and to share them later with a sighted viewer. The participants were able to use our app to identify each photograph on their own during the photo sharing session, and reported high satisfaction in having been able to take the initiative during the process.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/k9nf-uWVwxM?rel=0","title":"Accessible photo album: enhancing the photo sharing experience for people with visual impairment","filename":"CHI13/p2127","authors":["Susumu Harada","Daisuke Sato","Dustin W.
