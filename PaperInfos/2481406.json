We conducted a six-week self-reporting study on smartphone usage in order to investigate the accuracy of self-reported information, and used logged data as ground truth to compare the subjects' reports against. Subjects never recorded more than 70% and, depending on the requested reporting interval, down to less than 40% of actual app usages. They significantly overestimated how long they used apps. While subjects forgot self-reports when no automatic reminders were sent, a high reporting frequency was perceived as uncomfortable and burdensome. Most significantly, self-reporting even changed the actual app usage of users and hence can lead to deceptive measures if a study relies on no other data sources.With this contribution, we provide empirical quantitative long-term data on the reliability of self-reported data collected with mobile devices. We aim to make researchers aware of the caveats of self-reporting and give recommendations for maximizing the reliability of results when conducting large-scale, long-term app usage studies.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/l7BHY1QmmAs?rel=0","title":"Investigating self-reporting behavior in long-term studies","filename":"CHI13/p2931","authors":["Andreas Möller","Matthias Kranz","Barbara Schmid","Luis Roalter","Stefan Diewald"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
