While percussionists are accustomed to exploring non-traditional objects to create music, these objects have yet to encompass touch-screen computing devices to any great extent. The proliferation and popularity of these devices now presents an opportunity to explore their use in combining computer-generated sound together with percussive interaction in a musical ensemble.This paper examines Ensemble Metatone, a group formed to explore the \"infiltration\" of iPad-based musical instruments into a free-improvisation percussion ensemble. We discuss the design approach for two different iPad percussion instruments and the methodology for exploring them with the group over a series of rehearsals and performances. Qualitative analysis of discussions throughout this process shows that the musicians developed a vocabulary of gestures and musical interactions to make musical sense of these new instruments.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/NqdxCteYRFk?rel=0","title":"Exploring percussive gesture on iPads with ensemble metatone","filename":"CHI14/p1025","authors":["Charles Martin","Henry Gardner","Ben Swift"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
