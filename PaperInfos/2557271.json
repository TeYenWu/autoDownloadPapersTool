This paper examines a large-scale mobile battery awareness application, called Carat, to see how it changes user behavior with long-term use. We conducted a survey of current Carat Android users and analyzed their interaction logs. The results show that long-term Carat users save more battery, charge their devices less often, learn to manage their battery with less help from Carat, have a better understanding of how Carat works, and may enjoy competing against other users. Based on these findings, we propose a set of guidelines for mobile battery awareness applications: battery awareness applications should make the reasoning behind their recommendations understandable to the user, be tailored to retain long-term users, take the audience into account when formulating feedback, and distinguish third-party and system applications.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MHdepLfvnHs?rel=0","title":"How carat affects user behavior: implications for mobile battery awareness applications","filename":"CHI14/p1029","authors":["Kumaripaba Athukorala","Eemil Lagerspetz","Maria von Kügelgen","Antti Jylhä","Adam J.
