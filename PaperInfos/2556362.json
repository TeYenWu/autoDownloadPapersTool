{"paperId":2556362,"citation":[],"abstract":"Walter Gautschi has written extensively on topics ranging from special functions, quadrature and orthogonal polynomials to difference and differential equations, software implementations, and the history of mathematics. He is world renowned for his pioneering work in numerical analysis and constructive orthogonal polynomials, including a definitive textbook in the former, and a monograph in the latter area. This three-volume set, Walter Gautschi: Selected Works with Commentaries, is a compilation of Gautschis most influential papers and includes commentaries by leading experts. The work begins with a detailed biographical section and ends with a section commemorating Walters prematurely deceased twin brother. This title will appeal to graduate students and researchers in numerical analysis, as well as to historians of science.
