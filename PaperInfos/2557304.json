The status quo is that these phases occur separately, and the latter two have a significant amount of \"slack time\", where the camera operator is watching the scene unfold during capture, and the editor is re-watching and navigating through recorded footage during post-production. While this process is well suited to creating polished or professional video, video clips produced by casual video makers as seen in online forums could benefit from some editing without the overhead of current authoring tools. We introduce LACES, a tablet-based system enabling simple video manipulations in the midst of filming. Seamless in-situ integration of video capture and manipulation forms a novel workflow, allowing greater spontaneity and exploration of video creation.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/phnnEbv8QIA?rel=0","title":"LACES: live authoring through compositing and editing of streaming video","filename":"CHI14/p1207","authors":["Dustin Freeman","Stephanie Santosa","Fanny Chevalier","Ravin Balakrishnan","Karan Singh"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
