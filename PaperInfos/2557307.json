Our research covers a full design process including a qualitative-empirical pre-study, the prototyping process and the investigation of long-term appropriation processes of the stable prototypes in three different practice environments. Specifically, we deal with the problem of 'wandering' by persons suffering from late-phase dementia. Although GPS tracking is not a novel technological objective, the usage of those systems in dementia care remains very low. The paper therefore takes a socio-technical stance on development and appropriation of GPS technology in dementia care and assesses the practical and ideological issues surrounding care to understand why. We additionally provide design research in two different settings, familial and institutional care, and report on the design of a GPS-based tracking system reflecting these considerations. What comes to the fore is the need for ICT to reflect complex organizational, ideological and practical issues that form part of a moral universe where sensitivity is crucial.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/8dlcLKXgAvE?rel=0","title":"Addressing the subtleties in dementia care: pre-study & evaluation of a GPS monitoring system","filename":"CHI14/p3987","authors":["Lin Wan","Claudia Müller","Volker Wulf","David William Randall"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
