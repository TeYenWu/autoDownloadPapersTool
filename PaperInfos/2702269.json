{"paperId":2702269,"abstract":"Recent work has identified the lack of space usage rule (SUR) data -- e.g. \"no smoking\", \"no campfires\" -- as an important limitation of online/mobile maps that presents risks to user safety and the environment. In order to address this limitation, a large-scale means of mapping SURs must be developed. In this paper, we introduce and motivate the problem of mapping space usage rules and take the first steps towards identifying solutions. We show how computer vision can be employed to identify SUR indicators in the environment (e.g. \"No Smoking\" signs) with reasonable accuracy and describe techniques that can assign each rule to the appropriate geographic feature.","citation":[{"content":"Pavel Andreevich Samsonov , Johannes Schöning , Brent Hecht, A User Interface for Encoding Space Usage Rules Expressed in Natural Language, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 18-23, 2015, Seoul, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2732737"},{"content":"Pavel Andreevich Samsonov, Improving Interactions with Spatial Context-aware Services, Companion Publication of the 21st International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, March 07-10, 2016, Sonoma, California, USA","paperID":"2876459"}],"reference":[{"content":"Donoho, D.L. and Elad, M. 2003.
