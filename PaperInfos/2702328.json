{"paperId":2702328,"abstract":"Breastfeeding is positively encouraged across many countries as a public health endeavour. The World Health Organisation recommends breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months of an infant's life. However, women can struggle to breastfeed, and to persist with breastfeeding, for a number of reasons from technique to social acceptance. This paper reports on four phases of a design and research project, from sensitising user-engagement and user-centred design, to the development and in-the-wild deployment of a mobile phone application called FeedFinder. FeedFinder has been developed with breastfeeding women to support them in finding, reviewing and sharing public breastfeeding places with other breastfeeding women. We discuss how mobile technologies can be designed to support public health endeavours, and suggest that public health technologies are better aimed at communities and societies rather than individual.","citation":[{"content":"Patrick Olivier , Peter Wright, Digital civics: taking a local turn, interactions, v.22 n.4, July - August 2015","paperID":"2776885"}],"reference":[{"content":"Ernesto Arroyo , Leonardo Bonanni , Nina Valkanova, Embedded interaction in a water fountain for motivating behavior change in public space, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, May 05-10, 2012, Austin, Texas, USA","paperID":"2207773"},{"content":"Madeline Balaam , Stefan Rennick Egglestone , Geraldine Fitzpatrick , Tom Rodden , Ann-Marie Hughes , Anna Wilkinson , Thomas Nind , Lesley Axelrod , Eric Harris , Ian Ricketts , Susan Mawson , Jane Burridge, Motivating mobility: designing for lived motivation in stroke rehabilitation, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, May 07-12, 2011, Vancouver, BC, Canada","paperID":"1979397"},{"content":"Madeline Balaam , Judy Robertson , Geraldine Fitzpatrick , Rebecca Say , Gillian Hayes , Melissa Mazmanian , Belinda Parmar, Motherhood and HCI, CHI '13 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 27-May 02, 2013, Paris, France","paperID":"2479650"},{"content":"Shaowen Bardzell, Feminist HCI: taking stock and outlining an agenda for design, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 10-15, 2010, Atlanta, Georgia, USA","paperID":"1753521"},{"content":"Genevieve Bell , Paul Dourish, Back to the shed: gendered visions of technology and domesticity, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, v.11 n.5, p.373-381, June      2007","paperID":"1265397"},{"content":"Berridge, K., Mcfadden, K., Abayomi, J.
