From our experience, we present a series of general guidelines for those designing citizen science apps.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/l7zAEQa2ucE?rel=0","title":"Listening to the forest and its curators: lessons learnt from a bioacoustic smartphone application deployment","filename":"CHI14/p2387","authors":["Stuart Moran","Nadia Pantidi","Tom Rodden","Alan Chamberlain","Chloe Griffiths","Davide Zilli","Geoff Merrett","Alex Rogers"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
