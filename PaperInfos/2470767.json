We describe our experience using Twitter as a tool for student \"co-construction\" of lecture materials. Students were required to post a tweet prior to each lecture related to that day's topic, and these tweets -- consisting of questions, examples and reflections -- were incorporated into the lecture slides and notes. Students reported that they found lectures including their tweets in the class slides to be engaging, interactive and relevant, and nearly 90% of them recommended we use our co-construction approach again.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/-hx9n6kSvXg?rel=0","title":"Tweeting for class: co-construction as a means for engaging students in lectures","filename":"CHI13/p797","authors":["Jeremy Birnholtz","Jeff Hancock","Daniela Retelny"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
