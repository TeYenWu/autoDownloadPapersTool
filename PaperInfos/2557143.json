Online vendors have been experimenting ways to facilitate this activity. However, more research needs to be done on identifying what feature can create a pleasing shopping experience and ultimately encourage spending. In this paper, we present an exploration of the impact of co-navigation supports, including location cue, split screen, and shared view, on the experiences and performance of 60 co-shopper dyads. We also studied if status composition of shopping companions played a role in this process. By analyzing about 1800 minutes of eye-tracking data, video footages, and web logs, we found that split screen encouraged more diverse product search, shared view enabled better coordination, and location cue was the least distracting. Co-buyers achieved better factual and inference understanding, though buyer-advisor dyads were more likely to stay together.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/n2lWOokShoI?rel=0","title":"Share your view: impact of co-navigation support and status composition in collaborative online shopping","filename":"CHI14/p3299","authors":["Yanzhen Yue","Xiaojuan Ma","Zhenhui Jiang"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
