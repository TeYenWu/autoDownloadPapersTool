We introduce a novel approach for post-hoc editing of one specific aspect of cinematography -- camera motion style -- via an equalizer-like set of controls that manipulates the power spectra of a video's apparent motion path. We explore free manipulation of apparent camera motion as well as the transfer of motion styles from an example video to a new video to create a wide range of stylistic variations. We report on a user study confirming the ability of non-expert users to create motion styles.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/JmUERchkef8?rel=0","title":"Interactively stylizing camera motion","filename":"CHI14/p2051","authors":["Neel S.
