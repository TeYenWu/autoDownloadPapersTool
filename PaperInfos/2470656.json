We draw from Goffman's theatrical metaphor and Hogan's exhibition approach to explore how people manage their personal collection of social media data over time. We conducted a qualitative study of 13 participants to reveal their day-to-day decision-making about producing and curating digital traces on Facebook. Their goals and strategies showed that people experience the Facebook platform as consisting of three different functional regions: a performance region for managing recent data and impression management, an exhibition region for longer term presentation of self-image, and a personal region for archiving meaningful facets of life. Further, users' need for presenting and archiving data in these three regions is mediated by temporality. These findings trigger a discussion of how to design social media that support these dynamic and sometimes conflicting needs.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/jyulsNIY3fc?rel=0","title":"The many faces of facebook: experiencing social media as performance, exhibition, and personal archive","filename":"CHI13/p1","authors":["Xuan Zhao","Niloufar Salehi","Sasha Naranjit","Sara Alwaalan","Stephen Voida","Dan Cosley"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
