We begin to address this silo problem by attempting to build a bridge between the two disciplines at the level of behavioral theory. Specifically, we define core theoretical terms to create shared understanding about what theory is, discuss ways in which behavioral theory can be used to inform research on behavior change technologies, identify shortcomings in current behavioral theories, and outline ways in which HCI researchers can not only interpret and utilize behavioral science theories but also contribute to improving them.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/PBZhNAPpw5c?rel=0","title":"Mind the theoretical gap: interpreting, using, and developing behavioral theory in HCI research","filename":"CHI13/p3307","authors":["Eric B.
