However, most of the related studies are restricted to the case of single-point shear forces, possibly owing to the difficulty of independently sensing shear forces at multiple touch points. In this paper, we propose indirect methods to estimate shear forces using the movement of contact areas. These methods enable multi-point shear force estimation, where the estimation is done for each finger independently. We show the feasibility of these methods through an informal user study with a demo application utilizing these methods.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mlDHjLM4r9Q?rel=0","title":"Indirect shear force estimation for multi-point shear force operations","filename":"CHI13/p281","authors":["Seongkook Heo","Geehyuk Lee"],"conference":"CHI '13","reference":[{"content":"Sebastian Boring , David Ledo , Xiang 'Anthony' Chen , Nicolai Marquardt , Anthony Tang , Saul Greenberg, The fat thumb: using the thumb's contact size for single-handed mobile interaction, Proceedings of the 14th international conference on Human-computer interaction with mobile devices and services, September 21-24, 2012, San Francisco, California, USA","paperID":"2371582"},{"content":"Philip L.
