Informed by six months of participatory observation of twelve-step fellowship meetings and service structure, I conducted in-depth interviews with twelve members of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) about the role of technology in recovery. I found that there are a number of tensions in how technology is perceived and adopted. As technology and twelve-step fellowships interact, issues of anonymity, identity, consensus, access, unity, autonomy, and physical presence are foregrounded. I relate these findings to the broader research landscape and provide implications for future design in this space.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/SwbbXMZWroY?rel=0","title":"Shifting dynamics or breaking sacred traditions?: the role of technology in twelve-step fellowships","filename":"CHI13/p3413","authors":["Svetlana Yarosh"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
