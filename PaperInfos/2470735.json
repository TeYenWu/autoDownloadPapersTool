We describe the goals, design, and evaluation of ExposeHK, a new interface mechanism that aims to increase hotkey use. ExposeHK's four key design goals are: 1) enable users to browse hotkeys; 2) allow non-expert users to issue hotkey commands as a physical rehearsal of expert performance; 3) exploit spatial memory to assist non-expert users in identifying hotkeys; and 4) maximise expert performance by using consistent shortcuts in a flat command hierarchy. ExposeHK supports these objectives by displaying hotkeys overlaid on their associated commands when a modifier key is pressed. We evaluated ExposeHK in three empirical studies using toolbars, menus, and a tabbed \\'18ribbon' toolbar. Results show that participants used more hotkeys, and used them more often, with ExposeHK than with other techniques; they were faster with ExposeHK than with either pointing or other hotkey methods; and they strongly preferred ExposeHK. Our research shows that ExposeHK can substantially improve the user's transition from a \\'18beginner mode' of interaction to a higher level of expertise.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4hsfR7mSKhs?rel=0","title":"Promoting Hotkey use through rehearsal with ExposeHK","filename":"CHI13/p573","authors":["Sylvain Malacria","Gilles Bailly","Joel Harrison","Andy Cockburn","Carl Gutwin"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
