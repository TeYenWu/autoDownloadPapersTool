{"paperId":2702484,"abstract":"Symbol-based dictionaries of text, images and sound can help individuals with aphasia find the words they need, but are often seen as a last resort because they tend to replace rather than augment the user's natural speech. Through two design investigations, we explore head-worn displays as a means of providing unobtrusive, always-available, and glanceable vocabulary support. The first study used narrative storyboards as a design probe to explore the potential benefits and challenges of a head-worn approach over traditional augmented alternative communication (AAC) tools. The second study then evaluated a proof-of-concept prototype in both a lab setting with the researcher and in situ with unfamiliar conversation partners at a local market. Findings suggest that a head-worn approach could better allow wearers to maintain focus on the conversation, reduce reliance on the availability of external tools (e.g., paper and pen) or people, and minimize visibility of the support by others. These studies should motivate further investigation of head-worn conversational support.","citation":[{"content":"Marcin Wichrowski , Danijel Kor≈æinek , Krzysztof Szklanny, Google Glass Development in Practice: UX Design Sprint Workshops, Proceedings of the Mulitimedia, Interaction, Design and Innnovation, June 29-30, 2015, Warsaw, Poland","paperID":"2814475"}],"reference":[{"content":"Allen, M., McGrenere, J., and Purves, B.
