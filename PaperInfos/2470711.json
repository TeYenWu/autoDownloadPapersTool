We developed a process to identify Regularly Visited Patches (RVP) and a set of metrics to characterize and measure their spatial patterns. Using a large dataset of Foursquare check-ins as a test bed, we show that RVP analysis reveals fundamental patterns of human mobility and will lead to promising research with strong implications for businesses.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/3gyUCE3CQ3g?rel=0","title":"Regularly visited patches in human mobility","filename":"CHI13/p395","authors":["Yan Qu","Jun Zhang"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
