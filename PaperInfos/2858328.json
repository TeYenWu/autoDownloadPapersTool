{"paperId":2858328,"citation":[],"abstract":"This note presents a system that learns expressive and idiosyncratic gesture variations for gesture-based interaction. The system is used as an interaction technique in a music conducting scenario where gesture variations drive music articulation. A simple model based on Gaussian Mixture Modeling is used to allow the user to configure the system by providing variation examples. The system performance and the influence of user musical expertise is evaluated in a user study, which shows that the model is able to learn idiosyncratic variations that allow users to control articulation, with better performance for users with musical expertise.","reference":[{"content":"Sarah Fdili Alaoui, Baptiste Caramiaux, Marcos Serrano, and Frederic Bevilacqua. 2012.
