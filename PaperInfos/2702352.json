To engage taxpayers in the public discussion around budgetary issues, we leverage news articles containing budgetary information for design opportunities. We present Factful, a web-based annotative article reading interface that enhances the article with fact-checking support and contextual budgetary information by processing open government data. In our lab study, participants using Factful discussed more critically with more fact-based supporting statements. They built a rich context surrounding the relevant budget facts beyond what was presented in the article. Factful presents a simple yet powerful model for supporting fact-oriented budgetary discussions online by leveraging open government data.","title":"Factful: Engaging Taxpayers in the Public Discussion of a Government Budget","filename":"CHI15/p2843","authors":["Juho Kim","Eun-Young Ko","Jonghyuk Jung","Chang Won Lee","Nam Wook Kim","Jihee Kim"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
