However little is known whether these two capabilities are conflicting or compatible with each other in the keyboard parameter tuning. Applying computational optimization methods, this work explores the optimality issues related to them. The work demonstrates that it is possible to simultaneously optimize a keyboard algorithm for both correction and completion. The keyboard simultaneously optimized for both introduces no compromise to correction and only a slight compromise to completion when compared to the keyboards exclusively optimized for one objective. Our research also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed optimization method in keyboard algorithm design, which is based on the Pareto multi-objective optimization and the Metropolis algorithm. For the development and test datasets used in our experiments, computational optimization improved the correction accuracy rate by 8.3% and completion power by 17.7%.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mv2Y7X8kKg4?rel=0","title":"Both complete and correct?: multi-objective optimization of touchscreen keyboard","filename":"CHI14/p2297","authors":["Xiaojun Bi","Tom Ouyang","Shumin Zhai"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
