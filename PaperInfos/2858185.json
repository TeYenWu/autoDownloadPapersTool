Due in part to its low cost, ketamine has become one of the most popular club drugs among young adults and teenagers in Southeast Asia. This paper proposes a phone-based support system (KeDiary) with Bluetooth-enabled device for the screening of saliva, as a means of assisting ketamine-dependent patients to self-monitor their ketamine use following acute withdrawal treatment. We also conducted a practical experiment to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed system, wherein three ketamine-dependent patients self-administered tests at least once per day over a period of three weeks. Follow-up interviews with the same users helped in the further refinement of the proposed self-monitoring system.","title":"KeDiary: Using Mobile Phones to Assist Patients in Recovering from Drug Addiction","filename":"CHI16/p5704","authors":["Chuang-Wen You","Ya-Fang Lin","Cheng-Yuan Li","Yu-Lun Tsai","Ming-Chyi Huang","Chao-Hui Lee","Hao-Chuan Wang","Hao-Hua Chu"],"conference":"CHI '16"}
