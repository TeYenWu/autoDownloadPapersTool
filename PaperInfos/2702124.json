This paper contributes a novel dimension to this field of study by examining if a hybrid computer-human SMS system can engage pregnant women in Kenya in health-related communication. Our approach leverages the different strengths of both the computer and the human. The computer automates the bulk-sending of personalized messages to patients, allowing the human to read patients' replies and respond to those in need of attention. Findings from a 12-month deployment with 100 women show that our approach is capable of engaging the majority of participants in health-related conversations. We show that receiving messages from the system triggers participant communication and the amount of communication increases as participants approach their expected due date. In addition, analysis of participants' messages shows that they often contain sensitive health information conveyed through a complex mixture of languages and 'txting' abbreviations, all of which highlight the benefits of including a human in the workflow. Our findings are relevant for HCI researchers and practitioners interested in understanding or engaging underserved populations.","citation":[{"content":"Trevor Perrier , Brian DeRenzi , Richard Anderson, USSD: The Third Universal App, Proceedings of the 2015 Annual Symposium on Computing for Development, December 01-02, 2015, London, United Kingdom","paperID":"2830645"},{"content":"Susan Wyche, Exploring mobile phone and social media use in a Nairobi slum: a case for alternative approaches to design in ICTD, Proceedings of the Seventh International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies and Development, May 15-18, 2015, Singapore, Singapore","paperID":"2738019"}],"title":"Engaging Pregnant Women in Kenya with a Hybrid Computer-Human SMS Communication System","filename":"CHI15/p1429","authors":["Trevor Perrier","Nicola Dell","Brian DeRenzi","Richard Anderson","John Kinuthia","Jennifer Unger","Grace John-Stewart"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
