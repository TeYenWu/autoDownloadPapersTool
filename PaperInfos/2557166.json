Attached to a smart phone, Wrigglo captures the sender's motions and activates the receiver's Wrigglo which repeats the motion simultaneously. The result of our in-lab use observation with twelve couples showed that Wrigglo supported emotional and functional roles of body gestures and postures, creating vocabularies related to the motion of specific body parts and, to some extent, reflected the connected user's presence through the device's movement. Through its peripheral anthropomorphization, Wrigglo can deliver new forms of telepresence by embodied posturing and gesturing in mobile communication.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/1s1jb2ftWWk?rel=0","title":"Wrigglo: shape-changing peripheral for interpersonal mobile communication","filename":"CHI14/p3973","authors":["Joohee Park","Young-Woo Park","Tek-Jin Nam"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
