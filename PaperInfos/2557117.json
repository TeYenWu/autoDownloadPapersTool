{"paperId":2557117,"abstract":"Children engage in free play for emotional, physical and social development; researchers have explored supporting free play between physically remote playmates using videoconferencing tools. We show that the configuration of the video conferencing setup affects play. Specifically, we show that a shared visual scene configuration promotes fundamentally active forms of engaged, co-operative play.","citation":[{"content":"Azusa Kadomura , Akira Matsuda , Jun Rekimoto, CASPER: A Haptic Enhanced Telepresence Exercise System for Elderly People, Proceedings of the 7th Augmented Human International Conference 2016, p.1-8, February 25-27, 2016, Geneva, Switzerland","paperID":"2875197"}],"reference":[{"content":"Bronson, M.
