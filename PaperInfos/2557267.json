In particular, we report on an explorative design exercise about taking apart an unfamiliar device. Relating to this design situation, we provide accounts for how collaborative hands-on experience can support reaching common ground and acquiring shared material understanding in an interdisciplinary design team through establishing a material brief. In the end we reflect and discuss how this may complement our practices regarding materials and interaction design.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/B7R1AQDiUss?rel=0","title":"Taking things apart: reaching common ground and shared material understanding","filename":"CHI14/p469","authors":["Martin Murer","Mattias Jacobsson","Siri Skillgate","Petra Sundström"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
