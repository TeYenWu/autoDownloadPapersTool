{"paperId":2466232,"abstract":"When a patient has a chronic illness, such as heart disease or cancer, it can be challenging for distributed family members to stay aware of the patient's health status. A variety of technologies are available to support health information sharing (e.g., phone, video chat, social media), yet we still do not have a detailed understanding of which technologies are preferred and what challenges people still face when sharing information with them. To explore this, we conducted a mixed-method study-involving a survey and in-depth interviews--with people about their health information sharing routines and preferences for different technologies. Regardless of physical distance between distributed family members, synchronous methods of communication afforded the opportunity to provide affective support while asynchronous methods of communication were deemed to be the least intrusive. With family members adopting certain roles during the treatment of chronic illnesses, our findings suggest the need to design tools that mediate sharing health information across distance and age gaps, with consideration to respecting patient privacy while sharing health information.","reference":[{"content":"Alison Benjamin , Jeremy Birnholtz , Ronald Baecker , Diane Gromala , Andrea Furlan, Impression management work: how seniors with chronic pain address disruptions in their interactions, Proceedings of the ACM 2012 conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work, February 11-15, 2012, Seattle, Washington, USA","paperID":"2145324"},{"content":"A.J.
