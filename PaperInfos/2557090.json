However, designing objects for fabrication still requires 3D modeling skills, thereby rendering such technologies inaccessible to a wide user-group. In this paper, we introduce MixFab, a mixed-reality environment for personal fabrication that lowers the barrier for users to engage in personal fabrication. Users design objects in an immersive augmented reality environment, interact with virtual objects in a direct gestural manner and can introduce existing physical objects effortlessly into their designs. We describe the design and implementation of MixFab, a user-defined gesture study that informed this design, show artifacts designed with the system and describe a user study evaluating the system's prototype.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MhLuMWkHfM0?rel=0","title":"MixFab: a mixed-reality environment for personal fabrication","filename":"CHI14/p3855","authors":["Christian Weichel","Manfred Lau","David Kim","Nicolas Villar","Hans W.
