Our hardware comprises of low-resolution matrix of infrared (IR) proximity sensors interspersed between the keys of a regular mechanical keyboard. This results in coarse but high frame-rate motion data. We extend a machine learning algorithm, traditionally used for static classification only, to robustly support dynamic, temporal gestures. We propose the use of motion signatures a technique that utilizes pairs of motion history images and a random forest based classifier to robustly recognize a large set of motion gestures on and directly above the keyboard. Our technique achieves a mean per-frame classification accuracy of 75.6% in leave-one-subject-out and 89.9% in half-test/half-training cross-validation. We detail our hardware and gesture recognition algorithm, provide performance and accuracy numbers, and demonstrate a large set of gestures designed to be performed with our device. We conclude with qualitative feedback from users, discussion of limitations and areas for future work.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/_3dWZgKgDcQ?rel=0","title":"Type-hover-swipe in 96 bytes: a motion sensing mechanical keyboard","filename":"CHI14/p1695","authors":["Stuart Taylor","Cem Keskin","Otmar Hilliges","Shahram Izadi","John Helmes"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
