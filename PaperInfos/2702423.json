This paper presents a system for remote paper prototype testing that consists of (1) a video camera placed over a paper prototype, which streams a live audio-visual feed via Google Hangouts to a tester, and (2) Google Glass on the tester, which streams a live audio-visual-data feed to the facilitator and wizard. Results from a pilot study found that remote paper prototype testing helped designers gain valuable insights through use in realistic scenarios.","title":"Remote Paper Prototype Testing","filename":"CHI15/p77","authors":["Kevin Chen","Haoqi Zhang"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
