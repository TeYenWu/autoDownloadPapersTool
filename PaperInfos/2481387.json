However, ultra-small computing platforms like the Sony SmartWatch and Apple iPod Nano lack a means of text entry. This limits their potential, despite the fact they are quite capable computers. In this work, we present a soft keyboard interaction technique called ZoomBoard that enables text entry on ultra-small devices. Our approach uses iterative zooming to enlarge otherwise impossibly tiny keys to comfortable size. We based our design on a QWERTY layout, so that it is immediately familiar to users and leverages existing skill. As the ultimate test, we ran a text entry experiment on a keyboard measuring just 16 x 6mm - smaller than a US penny. After eight practice trials, users achieved an average of 9.3 words per minute, with accuracy comparable to a full-sized physical keyboard. This compares favorably to existing mobile text input methods.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/HlNg_t0qUW8?rel=0","title":"ZoomBoard: a diminutive qwerty soft keyboard using iterative zooming for ultra-small devices","filename":"CHI13/p2799","authors":["Stephen Oney","Chris Harrison","Amy Ogan","Jason Wiese"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
