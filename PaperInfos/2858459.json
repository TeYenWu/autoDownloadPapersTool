In this paper we discuss this topic through the Japanese concept of Wabi-Sabi, a philosophy that embraces three basic realities of the material world: 'nothing lasts', 'nothing is finished', and 'nothing is perfect'. We use these concepts to reflect on four unique interactive artefacts, which all in different ways embrace aspects of Wabi-Sabi, in terms of their design gestalt, materiality, but also in terms of use practices. Further, we use our analysis to articulate three high-level principles that may help addressing the long-term realities faced in physical interaction design, and for the design of interactive systems in general.","title":"Expanding on Wabi-Sabi as a Design Resource in HCI","filename":"CHI16/p5970","authors":["Vasiliki Tsaknaki","Ylva Fernaeus"],"conference":"CHI '16"}
