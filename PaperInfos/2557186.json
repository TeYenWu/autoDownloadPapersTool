Prior work has shown large potential of user-generated content on public displays. However, one of the problems with user-generated content on public displays is moderation as content may be explicit or troublesome for a particular location. In this work we explore the expectations of users with regard to content moderation on public displays. An online survey revealed that people not only think that display content should be moderated but also that a delay of up to 10 minutes is acceptable if display content is moderated. In a subsequent in the wild deployment we compared different moderation delays. We found that a moderation delay significantly decreases the number of user-generated posts while at the same time there is no significant effect on users' decision to repeatedly post on the display.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ej167deYFCw?rel=0","title":"I can wait a minute: uncovering the optimal delay time for pre-moderated user-generated content on public displays","filename":"CHI14/p1435","authors":["Miriam Greis","Florian Alt","Niels Henze","Nemanja Memarovic"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
