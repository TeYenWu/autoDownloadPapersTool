Our approach requires no direct instrumentation of the hand or body, and is non-optical, allowing for a compact form-factor that is resilient to ambient illumination. Our simple driver electronics are based on an off-the-shelf chip that removes the need for building custom analog electronics. We describe the design of our transparent electrode array, and present a machine learning algorithm for mapping from signal measurements at the receivers to 3D positions. We demonstrate non-contact motion gestures, and precise 3D hand and finger localization. We conclude by discussing limitations and future work.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/OLLBPRbu-0A?rel=0","title":"A low-cost transparent electric field sensor for 3d interaction on mobile devices","filename":"CHI14/p3167","authors":["Mathieu Le Goc","Stuart Taylor","Shahram Izadi","Cem Keskin"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
