We investigate the concept of outfit-centric design by extending the support for social and visual interaction with digital devices beyond the currently available shells and stickers, and drawing on the ways in which people vary their dress ensembles. We designed a set of mock-up samples in a local fashion style, as a first step in understanding possible applications of the emerging technology of organic interfaces. Initial user feedback shows how fashion-conscious participants creatively experimented with the set's variations of shape and color in outfits created from their personal wardrobes, which revealed the importance of the objects' size and location on the body. It also points out that a lack of integration with the fashion system's processes reduces the attractiveness of the samples.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/P3NkR5touNI?rel=0","title":"Fashionable shape switching: explorations in outfit-centric design","filename":"CHI13/p1353","authors":["Oskar Juhlin","Yanqing Zhang","Cristine Sundbom","Ylva Fernaeus"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
