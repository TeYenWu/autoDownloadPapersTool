While we focus on development of a system to aid analysis of elephant movement, the resulting interaction techniques and facilities are quite general. The paper highlights how our design evolved to balance the goals of researchers, their current practices, and the challenges of integrating the relatively unconstrained world of pen and paper with the relatively constrained world of digital systems.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/LbIHRE_SQfc?rel=0","title":"Reifying social movement trajectories","filename":"CHI13/p2945","authors":["Adam Fouse","Nadir Weibel","Christine Johnson","James D.
