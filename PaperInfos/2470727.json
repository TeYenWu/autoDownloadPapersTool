Major outcomes include: employee proposals that addressed diverse individual and organizational needs; high participation rates; extensive inter-departmental collaboration, including the discovery of large numbers of previously unknown collaborators; and the development of goals and motivations based on collective concerns at multiple levels of project groups, communities of practice, and the organization as a whole. We recommend further, comparative research into crowd-funding and other forms of employee-initiated innovations.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/W1YxrRjk-Z8?rel=0","title":"Crowdfunding inside the enterprise: employee-initiatives for innovation and collaboration","filename":"CHI13/p503","authors":["Michael Muller","Werner Geyer","Todd Soule","Steven Daniels","Li-Te Cheng"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
