With the advent of embedded projectors this might change. We conducted a study with 56 participants to find out if map navigation and spatial memory performance among users and observers can be improved by using a projector phone with a peephole interface instead of a smartphone with its touchscreen interface. Our results show that users performed map navigation equally well on both interfaces. Spatial memory performance, however, was 41% better for projector phone users. Moreover, observers of the map navigation on the projector phone were 25% more accurate when asked to recall locations of points of interest after they watched a user performing map navigation.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/AUDU8fE_kjo?rel=0","title":"Studying spatial memory and map navigation performance on projector phones with peephole interaction","filename":"CHI13/p3173","authors":["Bonifaz Kaufmann","David Ahlström"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
