An essential prerequisite for such a touchpad is a robust palm rejection method, which we satisfy using a proximity-sensing touchpad. We developed LongPad, a proximity-sensing optical touchpad that is as wide as a laptop keyboard, and implemented a palm rejection algorithm that utilizes proximity images from LongPad. In a user study conducted, we observed that LongPad rejected palm touches almost perfectly while participants were repeating typing and pointing tasks. We also summarize the new design space enabled by LongPad and demonstrate a few of the interaction techniques it facilitates.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/JdGqYoPOUYk?rel=0","reference":[{"content":"Michelle Annett , Tovi Grossman , Daniel Wigdor , George Fitzmaurice, Medusa: a proximity-aware multi-touch tabletop, Proceedings of the 24th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology, October 16-19, 2011, Santa Barbara, California, USA","paperID":"2047240"},{"content":"Apple, Magic TrackPad. http://www.apple.com/magictrackpad/","paperID":"None"},{"content":"Batra, S., Dykstra, D., Hsu, P., Radle, K., and Wiedenbeck, S., Pointing Device Performance for Laptop Computers.
