What modern presentations gain through visual slide support, however, is often at the expense of storytelling. We present TurningPoint, a probe to investigate the potential use of narrative-driven talk planning in slideware. Our study of TurningPoint reveals a delicate balance between narrative templates focusing author attention in ways that save time, and fixating attention in ways that limit experimentation.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/tjASJSb8NuE?rel=0","title":"TurningPoint: narrative-driven presentation planning","filename":"CHI14/p1591","authors":["Larissa Pschetz","Koji Yatani","Darren Edge"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
