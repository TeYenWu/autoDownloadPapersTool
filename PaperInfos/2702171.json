Existing research mainly focuses on the way in which individual platforms are used by volunteers in response to disasters. This paper examines the use of social media during the European Floods of 2013 and proposes a novel cross-social-media application for volunteers. Besides comprehensive analysis of volunteer communities, interviews were conducted with \"digital volunteers\" such as Facebook moderators of disaster-related groups. Based on the challenges identified, we designed and implemented the cross-social-media application \"XHELP\", which allows information to be both, acquired and distributed cross-media and cross-channel. The evaluation with 20 users leads to further design requirements for applications aiming to support volunteer moderators during disasters.","reference":[{"content":"Andreas Birkbak, Crystallizations in the blizzard: contrasting informal emergency collaboration in Facebook groups, Proceedings of the 7th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction: Making Sense Through Design, October 14-17, 2012, Copenhagen, Denmark","paperID":"2399082"},{"content":"BITKOM.
