Using simple, low-resolution capacitive touch sensors placed around a standard phone, we outline a machine learning approach to modelling the grip modulation and inferring front-of-screen touch targets. We experimentally demonstrate that grip is a remarkably good predictor of touch, and we can predict touch position 200ms before contact with an accuracy of 18mm.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/2wqq8PzpRww?rel=0","title":"28 frames later: predicting screen touches from back-of-device grip changes","filename":"CHI14/p2005","authors":["Mohammad Faizuddin Mohd Noor","Andrew Ramsay","Stephen Hughes","Simon Rogers","John Williamson","Roderick Murray-Smith"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
