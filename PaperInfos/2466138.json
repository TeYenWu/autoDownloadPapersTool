The primary aim of this work was to evaluate the communicative and cooperative behavior of same-age and mixed-age pairs, with secondary interests in their perceived ease-of-use of the game. A mixed-method approach was used, comprising of direct observations, a post-game questionnaire and paired interviews. Our results identified noticeable differences between the group-types, with the Young-Old showing more physical cooperation, as compared to the same-age groups. The work elaborates on how the young and old differ in expectations and perceived interaction, and concludes with some recommendations for future research.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/p3YxlHO_l8E?rel=0","title":"The dynamics of younger and older adult's paired behavior when playing an interactive silhouette game","filename":"CHI13/p1081","authors":["Mark Rice","Wah Pheow Tan","Jeremy Ong","Lih Jie Yau","Marcus Wan","Jamie Ng"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
