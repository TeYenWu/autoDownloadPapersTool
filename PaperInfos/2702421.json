A preliminary study with blind people reveals numerous difficulties with existing state-of-the-art technologies including problems with alignment, focus, accuracy, mobility and efficiency. In this paper, we present a finger-worn device, FingerReader, that assists blind users with reading printed text on the go. We introduce a novel computer vision algorithm for local-sequential text scanning that enables reading single lines, blocks of text or skimming the text with complementary, multimodal feedback. This system is implemented in a small finger-worn form factor, that enables a more manageable eyes-free operation with trivial setup. We offer findings from three studies performed to determine the usability of the FingerReader.","title":"FingerReader: A Wearable Device to Explore Printed Text on the Go","filename":"CHI15/p2363","authors":["Roy Shilkrot","Jochen Huber","Wong Meng Ee","Pattie Maes","Suranga Chandima Nanayakkara"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
