We find trigger-action programming can express most desired behaviors submitted by participants in an online study. We identify a class of triggers requiring machine learning that has received little attention. We evaluate the uniqueness of the 67,169 trigger-action programs shared on IFTTT.com, finding that real users have written a large number of unique trigger-action interactions. Finally, we conduct a 226-participant usability test of trigger-action programming, finding that inexperienced users can quickly learn to create programs containing multiple triggers or actions.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/s_r7sL3g-IY?rel=0","title":"Practical trigger-action programming in the smart home","filename":"CHI14/p803","authors":["Blase Ur","Elyse McManus","Melwyn Pak Yong Ho","Michael L.
