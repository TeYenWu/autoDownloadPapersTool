However, its design requires that many design parameters such as tactor types and stimulus patterns be determined. We conducted a series of experiments to explore the design space of a WBTD consisting of 3Ã—3 tactors. We demonstrated that tactor types and the temporal patterns and locus of a stimulus produce statistically significant effects on the efficiency of a WBTD. The experimental results can act as a practical guideline for the design of an efficient WBTD.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/BNt1xC9wwLs?rel=0","title":"Investigating the Information Transfer Efficiency of a 3x3 Watch-back Tactile Display","filename":"CHI15/p1229","authors":["Jaeyeon Lee","Jaehyun Han","Geehyuk Lee"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
