{"paperId":2702610,"citation":[],"abstract":"A significant percentage of mobile interaction involves short-period usages that originate from the standby mode-users wake up a device by pressing the power button, unlock the device by authenticating themselves, and then search for a target app or functionality on the device. These additional steps preceding a target task imposes significant overhead on users for each mobile device access. To address the issue, we developed Gesture On, a system that enables gesture shortcuts in the standby mode by which a user can draw a gesture on the touchscreen before the screen is turned on. Based on the gesture, our system directly brings up a target item onto the screen that bypasses all these additional steps in a mobile access. This paper examines several challenges in realizing Gesture On, including robustly rejecting accidental touches when the device is in standby, battery consumption incurred for continuous sensing and gesture-based user authentication methods for automatically device unlocking. Our analyses based on a set of user data indicated that Gesture On demonstrates a feasible approach for leveraging the standby mode for fast access to mobile content.","reference":[{"content":"Shahriyar Amini , Yang Li, CrowdLearner: rapidly creating mobile recognizers using crowdsourcing, Proceedings of the 26th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology, October 08-11, 2013, St. Andrews, Scotland, United Kingdom","paperID":"2502029"},{"content":"Caroline Appert , Shumin Zhai, Using strokes as command shortcuts: cognitive benefits and toolkit support, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 04-09, 2009, Boston, MA, USA","paperID":"1519052"},{"content":"Matthias Böhmer , Brent Hecht , Johannes Schöning , Antonio Krüger , Gernot Bauer, Falling asleep with Angry Birds, Facebook and Kindle: a large scale study on mobile application usage, Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Human Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services, August 30-September 02, 2011, Stockholm, Sweden","paperID":"2037383"},{"content":"Feng, T., Liu, Z., Kwon, K.-A., Shi, W., Carbunar, B., Jiang, Y., and Nguyen, N.
