{"paperId":2702327,"abstract":"We present a new type of 3D printer that can form precise, but soft and deformable 3D objects from layers of off-the-shelf fabric. Our printer employs an approach where a sheet of fabric forms each layer of a 3D object. The printer cuts this sheet along the 2D contour of the layer using a laser cutter and then bonds it to previously printed layers using a heat sensitive adhesive. Surrounding fabric in each layer is temporarily retained to provide a removable support structure for layers printed above it. This process is repeated to build up a 3D object layer by layer. Our printer is capable of automatically feeding two separate fabric types into a single print. This allows specially cut layers of conductive fabric to be embedded in our soft prints. Using this capability we demonstrate 3D models with touch sensing capability built into a soft print in one complete printing process, and a simple LED display making use of a conductive fabric coil for wireless power reception.","citation":[{"content":"Gierad Laput , Xiang 'Anthony' Chen , Chris Harrison, 3D Printed Hair: Fused Deposition Modeling of Soft Strands, Fibers, and Bristles, Proceedings of the 28th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software & Technology, November 08-11, 2015, Daegu, Kyungpook, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2807484"},{"content":"Udayan Umapathi , Hsiang-Ting Chen , Stefanie Mueller , Ludwig Wall , Anna Seufert , Patrick Baudisch, LaserStacker: Fabricating 3D Objects by Laser Cutting and Welding, Proceedings of the 28th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software & Technology, November 08-11, 2015, Daegu, Kyungpook, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2807512"}],"reference":[{"content":"Moritz Bächer , Emily Whiting , Bernd Bickel , Olga Sorkine-Hornung, Spin-it: optimizing moment of inertia for spinnable objects, ACM Transactions on Graphics (TOG), v.33 n.4, July 2014","paperID":"2601157"},{"content":"Leah Buechley , Mike Eisenberg , Jaime Catchen , Ali Crockett, The LilyPad Arduino: using computational textiles to investigate engagement, aesthetics, and diversity in computer science education, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 05-10, 2008, Florence, Italy","paperID":"1357123"},{"content":"Cherenack, K., Zysset, C., Kinkeldei, T., Münzenrieder, N., and Tröster, G.
