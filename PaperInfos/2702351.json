{"paperId":2702351,"abstract":"In this paper we describe a study exploring why users spend more time in email than originally intended, which we call getting lost in email. To study this phenomenon, we implemented an IMAP logger that also dispatched diary entries to collect data for twenty participants over a two week period. Most participants reported getting lost in email during both short and long sessions. Our analysis suggests two primary factors in getting lost: the number of emails awaiting a reply and whether or not the session caused an interruption. We conclude that much of the problem around getting lost in email is in managing the tension between promptly responding to messages while limiting engagement with email.","citation":[],"reference":[{"content":"Olle Bälter , Candace L Sidner, Bifrost inbox organizer: giving users control over the inbox, Proceedings of the second Nordic conference on Human-computer interaction, October 19-23, 2002, Aarhus, Denmark","paperID":"572034"},{"content":"Victoria Bellotti , Nicolas Ducheneaut , Mark Howard , Ian Smith, Taking email to task: the design and evaluation of a task management centered email tool, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 05-10, 2003, Ft.
