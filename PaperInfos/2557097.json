Users can switch sides during input to minimize the risk of shoulder surfing. We performed a user study (n = 32) to explore how switching sides during authentication affects usability and security of the system. The results indicate that switching the sides increases security while authentication speed stays relatively fast (≤ 4 seconds). The paper furthermore provides insights on accuracy of eyes-free input (as used in XSide) and shows how 3D printed prototype cases can improve the back-of-device interaction experience.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ko7zShHg0yI?rel=0","title":"Now you see me, now you don't: protecting smartphone authentication from shoulder surfers","filename":"CHI14/p2937","authors":["Alexander De Luca","Marian Harbach","Emanuel von Zezschwitz","Max-Emanuel Maurer","Bernhard Ewald Slawik","Heinrich Hussmann","Matthew Smith"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
