This paper presents an immersive rainforest simulation and collective inquiry activity where students collect observational data from the environment and explore their peers' data through large visualization displays and personal mobile devices. Two iterations of the design were tested, which resulted in higher quality student explanations constructed. Images were found to be an important source of evidence for the explanations, more so than text-only evidence. We also found that patterns of collective ideas influenced student performance, and that visualizations, as ambient or plenary displays, supported both teacher and students in reviewing patterns of collected data.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/B9bmZlgacoU?rel=0","title":"Supporting learners in collecting and exploring data from immersive simulations in collective inquiry","filename":"CHI14/p2103","authors":["Michelle Lui","Alex C.
