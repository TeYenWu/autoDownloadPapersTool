TimeAware employs an ambient widget to promote self-awareness and to lower the feedback access burden, and web-based information dashboard to visualize people's detailed computer usage. To examine the effect of framing on individual's productivity, we designed two versions of TimeAware, each with a different framing setting-one emphasizing productive activities (positive framing) and the other emphasizing distracting activities (negative framing), and conducted an eight-week deployment study (N = 24). We found a significant effect of framing on participants' productivity: only participants in the negative framing condition improved their productivity. The ambient widget seemed to help sustain engagement with data and enhance self-awareness. We discuss how to leverage framing effects to help people enhance their productivity, and how to design successful productivity monitoring tool.","title":"TimeAware: Leveraging Framing Effects to Enhance Personal Productivity","filename":"CHI16/p272","authors":["Young-Ho Kim","Jae Ho Jeon","Eun Kyoung Choe","Bongshin Lee","KwonHyun Kim","Jinwook Seo"],"conference":"CHI '16"}
