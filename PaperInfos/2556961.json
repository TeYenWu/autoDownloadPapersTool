The participants' experiences of money, banking and the role digital technology plays in their financial practices were identified through semi-structured interviews in people's homes and group workshops. A grounded theory analysis of these data characterises how technology both helped and hindered participants to keep close control of their finances. These findings suggest design opportunities for future digital banking technologies that extend the already sophisticated practices of individuals managing a low income, focusing on: delaying, prioritising, planning, watching, and hiding monetary transactions.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/45KIFu3cbjo?rel=0","title":"Pay or delay: the role of technology when managing a low income","filename":"CHI14/p501","authors":["John Vines","Paul Dunphy","Andrew Monk"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
