In this paper, we present InkAnchor, a digital ink editor that allows users to easily create ink-based notes by finger drawing and writing on a mobile phone touchscreen. InkAnchor incorporates flexible anchoring, focus-plus-context input, content chunking, and lightweight editing mechanisms to support the capture of informal notes and annotations. We describe the design and evaluation of InkAnchor through a series of user studies, which revealed that the integrated support enabled by InkAnchor is a significant improvement over current mobile note taking applications on a range of mobile note-taking tasks.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/MMf_3KfRCvM?rel=0","title":"InkAnchor: enhancing informal ink-based note taking on touchscreen mobile phones","filename":"CHI14/p1123","authors":["Yi Ren","Yang Li","Edward Lank"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
