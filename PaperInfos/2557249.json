This is known as the \"intention gap\" and is particularly problematic when searching for and discriminating between online video content. An author uses description and meta-data tags to label their content, but often cannot predict alternate interpretations or appropriations of their work. To address this intention gap, we present ThumbReels, a concept for query-sensitive video previews generated from crowdsourced, temporally defined semantic tagging. Further, we supply an open-source tool that supports on-the-fly temporal tagging of videos, whose output can be used for later search queries. A first user study validates the tool and concept. We then present a second study that shows participants found ThumbReels to better represent search terms than contemporary preview techniques.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/15jv2oHhF5Y?rel=0","title":"ThumbReels: query sensitive web video previews based on temporal, crowdsourced, semantic tagging","filename":"CHI14/p1217","authors":["Barnaby Craggs","Myles Kilgallon Scott","Jason Alexander"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
