We present Around-Device Binning, or AD-Binning, a novel mobile user interface that allows users to off-load mobile content in the space around the device. We informed our implementation of AD-Binning by exploring various design factors, such as the minimum around-device target size, suitable item selection methods, and techniques for placing content in off-screen space. In a task requiring exploration, we find that AD-Binning improves browsing efficiency by avoiding the minute selection and flicking mechanisms needed for on-screen interaction. We conclude with design guidelines for off screen content storage and browsing.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mtL6BklCFfg?rel=0","title":"Ad-binning: leveraging around device space for storing, browsing and retrieving mobile device content","filename":"CHI13/p899","authors":["Khalad Hasan","David Ahlström","Pourang Irani"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
