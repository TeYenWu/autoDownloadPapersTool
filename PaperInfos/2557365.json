One of the main reasons is the limited number of available displays in the environment which is a fundamental requirement of the original vision. We introduce the concept of an Ambient Mobile Pervasive Display AMP-D which is a wearable projector system that constantly projects an ambient information display in front of the user. The floor display provides serendipitous access to public and personal information. The display is combined with a projected display on the user's hand, forming a continuous interaction space that is controlled by hand gestures. The paper introduces this novel device concept, discusses its interaction design, and explores its advantages through various implemented application examples. Furthermore, we present the AMP-D prototype which illustrates the involved challenges concerning hardware, sensing, and visualization.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/5P7Z50l9UOo?rel=0","title":"Pervasive information through constant personal projection: the ambient mobile pervasive display (AMP-D)","filename":"CHI14/p4117","authors":["Christian Winkler","Julian Seifert","David Dobbelstein","Enrico Rukzio"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
