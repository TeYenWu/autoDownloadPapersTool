However, users do not always choose to install updates. Through interviewing non-expert Windows users, we found that users frequently decide not to install future updates, regardless of whether they are important for security, after negative experiences with past updates. This means that even non-security updates (such as user interface changes) can impact the security of a computer. We discuss three themes impacting users' willingness to install updates: unexpected new features in an update, the difficulty of assessing whether an update is ``worth it', and confusion about why an update is necessary.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/1n6rOkEu_f8?rel=0","title":"Betrayed by updates: how negative experiences affect future security","filename":"CHI14/p2671","authors":["Kami E.
