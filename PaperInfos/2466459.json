{"paperId":2466459,"abstract":"We present a comparative evaluation of two touch-based group-binding methods, a leader-driven method and a peer-based method, against a more conventional group-binding method based on scanning and passwords. The results indicate that the participants strongly preferred the touch-based methods in both pragmatic and hedonic qualities as well as in the overall attractiveness. While the leader-driven method allowed better control over the group and required only one participant to be able to form a group, the peer-based method helped to create a greater sense of community and scaled better for larger group sizes and distances. As the optimal group-binding method depends on the social situation and physical environment, the binding methods should be flexible, allowing the users to adapt them to different contexts of use. For determining the order of the devices, manual arrangement was preferred over defining the order by touching.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/669DqNxirK0?rel=0","citation":[{"content":"Kazunori Shiomi , Ryo Nishide , Hideyuki Takada, Terminal Group Formation with Detection of Relative Position Using Camera Image Recognition, Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference Companion on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing, March 14-18, 2015, Vancouver, BC, Canada","paperID":"2702669"},{"content":"Tero Jokela , Andrés Lucero, MixedNotes: a digital tool to prepare physical notes for affinity diagramming, Proceedings of the 18th International Academic MindTrek Conference: Media Business, Management, Content & Services, November 04-06, 2014, Tampere, Finland","paperID":"2676478"},{"content":"Tero Jokela , Ming Ki Chong , Andrés Lucero , Hans Gellersen, Connecting devices for collaborative interactions, interactions, v.22 n.4, July - August 2015","paperID":"2776887"},{"content":"Tero Jokela , Andrés Lucero, FlexiGroups: binding mobile devices for collaborative interactions in medium-sized groups with device touch, Proceedings of the 16th international conference on Human-computer interaction with mobile devices & services, September 23-26, 2014, Toronto, ON, Canada","paperID":"2628376"}],"reference":[{"content":"Yuji Ayatsuka , Jun Rekimoto, tranSticks: physically manipulatable virtual connections, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 02-07, 2005, Portland, Oregon, USA","paperID":"1055008"},{"content":"Ming Ki Chong , Hans Gellersen, How users associate wireless devices, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, May 07-12, 2011, Vancouver, BC, Canada","paperID":"1979219"},{"content":"Ming Ki Chong , Hans Gellersen, Usability classification for spontaneous device association, Personal and Ubiquitous Computing, v.16 n.1, p.77-89, January   2012","paperID":"2124487"},{"content":"Hart, S.
