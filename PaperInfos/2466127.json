We explore the practices that developed as a set of course materials were released as OER from the UK, remixed for a US context by a cross-organisational, cross-cultural team, and then reused in a broad range of educational settings. We analyse the approaches taken during these remixing and reuse activities as novel forms of creative collaboration. As a basis for comparison, we explore similarities and differences with openness in other domains. We identify how openness provoked novel inter-organisational collaboration and forms of ownership; define forms of open practice that need support, and present issues that should be considered in devising and supporting open projects in education and beyond.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/BQpSHcZXqK8?rel=0","title":"Building open bridges: collaborative remixing and reuse of open educational resources across organisations","filename":"CHI13/p991","authors":["Tim Coughlan","Rebecca Pitt","Patrick McAndrew"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
