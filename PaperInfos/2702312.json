Earlier work on its effect on performance has been inconclusive, however, because movement has not been experimentally controlled. In a first experiment, we controlled participants' ability to physically move in front of a 3-meter wide 24-megapixel wall-display. Participants performed a classification task involving navigation using a zoom-and-pan interface. Results suggest that the ability to move does not increase performance, and that a majority of participants used virtual navigation (i.e., zooming and panning) and little or no physical navigation (i.e., moving their bodies). To isolate the effects of physical and virtual navigation, a second experiment compared conditions where participants could navigate using either only physical movement or only virtual navigation. The second experiment showed that physical movement does benefit performance. The results from the experiments suggest that moving may not be improving performance, depending on the use of virtual navigation.","reference":[{"content":"Christopher Andrews , Chris North, The Impact of Physical Navigation on Spatial Organization for Sensemaking, IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, v.19 n.12, p.2207-2216, December 2013","paperID":"2553723"},{"content":"Robert Ball , Chris North, Effects of tiled high-resolution display on basic visualization and navigation tasks, CHI '05 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 02-07, 2005, Portland, OR, USA","paperID":"1056875"},{"content":"Robert Ball , Chris North, Visual Analytics: Realizing embodied interaction for visual analytics through large displays, Computers and Graphics, v.31 n.3, p.380-400, June, 2007","paperID":"1244749"},{"content":"Robert Ball , Chris North, The effects of peripheral vision and physical navigation on large scale visualization, Proceedings of Graphics Interface 2008, May 28-30, 2008, Windsor, Ontario, Canada","paperID":"1375717"},{"content":"Robert Ball , Chris North , Doug A.
