By using the initially applied pressure level for implicit mode switching, a gesture can be enhanced with different functionalities to enlarge the interaction space for multi-touch. To evaluate the feasibility of our concept, we conducted an experiment, which indicates good human sensorimotor skills for performing multi-touch gestures with a few number of pressure levels and without any additional feedback. Based on the experimental results, we discuss implications for the design of pressure-sensitive multi-touch gestures, and propose application scenarios that make optimal use of our concept.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/3KZQsRIoMEk?rel=0","title":"Presstures: exploring pressure-sensitive multi-touch gestures on trackpads","filename":"CHI14/p431","authors":["Christian Rendl","Patrick Greindl","Kathrin Probst","Martin Behrens","Michael Haller"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
