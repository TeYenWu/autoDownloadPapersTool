While previous systems have introduced sketch-based animations for individual objects, our contribution is a unified framework of motion controls that allows users to seamlessly add coordinated motions to object collections. We propose a framework built around kinetic textures, which provide continuous animation effects while preserving the unique timeless nature of still illustrations. This enables many dynamic effects difficult or not possible with previous sketch-based tools, such as a school of fish swimming, tree leaves blowing in the wind, or water rippling in a pond. We describe our implementation and illustrate the repertoire of animation effects it supports. A user study with professional animators and casual users demonstrates the variety of animations, applications and creative possibilities our tool provides.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/lDoodhfaj5I?rel=0","citation":[{"content":"Rubaiat Habib Kazi , Fanny Chevalier , Tovi Grossman , Shengdong Zhao , George Fitzmaurice, Draco: living illustrations, CHI '14 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 26-May 01, 2014, Toronto, Ontario, Canada","paperID":"2579483"},{"content":"Rubaiat Habib Kazi , Fanny Chevalier , Tovi Grossman , Shengdong Zhao , George Fitzmaurice, DRACO: sketching animated drawings with kinetic textures, ACM SIGGRAPH 2014 Posters, August 10-14, 2014, Vancouver, Canada","paperID":"2614221"},{"content":"Rubaiat Habib Kazi , Fanny Chevalier , Tovi Grossman , Shengdong Zhao , George Fitzmaurice, DRACO: sketching animated drawings with kinetic textures, ACM SIGGRAPH 2014 Studio, August 10-14, 2014, Vancouver, Canada","paperID":"2656322"},{"content":"Muhammad Arief , Kunio Kondo , Koji Mikami , Hideki Todo , Yasushi Yamaguchi, Controllable region via texture projection for stylized shading, Proceedings of the 14th ACM SIGGRAPH International Conference on Virtual Reality Continuum and its Applications in Industry, October 30-November 01, 2015, Kobe, Japan","paperID":"2817688"},{"content":"Rubaiat Habib Kazi , Fanny Chevalier , Tovi Grossman , Shengdong Zhao , George Fitzmaurice, Draco: bringing life to illustrations, CHI '14 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 26-May 01, 2014, Toronto, Ontario, Canada","paperID":"2574769"},{"content":"Rubaiat Habib Kazi , Fanny Chevalier , Tovi Grossman , George Fitzmaurice, Kitty: sketching dynamic and interactive illustrations, Proceedings of the 27th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology, October 05-08, 2014, Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","paperID":"2647375"},{"content":"Tovi Grossman , Fanny Chevalier , Rubaiat Habib Kazi, Your Paper is Dead!: Bringing Life to Research Articles with Animated Figures, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 18-23, 2015, Seoul, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2732501"},{"content":"Antoine Milliez , Gioacchino Noris , Ilya Baran , Stelian Coros , Marie-Paule Cani , Maurizio Nitti , Alessia Marra , Markus Gross , Robert W.
