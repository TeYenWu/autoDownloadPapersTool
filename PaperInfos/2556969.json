The analysis is conducted for two time periods (1994-2003, 2004-2013) and a comparison between them highlights the underlying trends in our community. More significantly, this study identifies the evolution of major themes in the discipline, and highlights individual topics as popular, core, or backbone research topics within HCI.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/c3Fkz3Jul9M?rel=0","title":"CHI 1994-2013: mapping two decades of intellectual progress through co-word analysis","filename":"CHI14/p3553","authors":["Yong Liu","Jorge Goncalves","Denzil Ferreira","Bei Xiao","Simo Hosio","Vassilis Kostakos"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
