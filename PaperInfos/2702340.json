The key idea of EyeBookmark is to provide a visual cue to help people decide where to resume reading. We design four highlighting methods and conduct a controlled user study with a proof-of-concept design to verify the usefulness of EyeBookmark. The user study demonstrates not only that participants preferred our highlighting methods but also that such highlighting methods significantly reduced the time taken to resume reading after interruption regardless of the difficulty of text.","title":"EyeBookmark: Assisting Recovery from Interruption during Reading","filename":"CHI15/p2963","authors":["Jaemin Jo","Bohyoung Kim","Jinwook Seo"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
