{"paperId":2702542,"abstract":"Motivation studies on running are often focused on how to convince non-runners to run, mainly through designing for extrinsic motivations such as health concerns or external reward systems. In contrast, we conducted a structured inquiry into understanding how to design technology for those whom are already committed to running and participate in organized races. Through interviews, focus groups, ethnographic observation, questionnaires, and design-based research over the course of two years, we investigated the needs of the advanced amateur runner community. An analysis of the gathered data led to five design themes -- Festival, Competition, Practicalities, Togetherness, and Support -- to inform future runner motivation technology. While flow theory appears to be a convenient tool to understand support during a race, we observed a number of other factors that need to be considered. Through combining the themes with previous research, we conclude by presenting nine guidelines for designing technology for this domain.","citation":[{"content":"Kristina Knaving , Paweł Wózniak, TickTockRun: Towards Enhancing Communication in Runner Families, Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing Companion, February 26-March 02, 2016, San Francisco, California, USA","paperID":"2869114"},{"content":"Paweł Woźniak , Kristina Knaving , Staffan Björk , Morten Fjeld, RUFUS: Remote Supporter Feedback for Long-Distance Runners, Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services, August 24-27, 2015, Copenhagen, Denmark","paperID":"2785893"}],"reference":[{"content":"Bloom, B.S. and Sosniak, L.A.
