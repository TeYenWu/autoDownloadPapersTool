Mixed-methods analyses revealed that the presence of a digital tabletop display led to improved sensemaking performance, and identified activities that were supported by the shared workspace. The digital tabletop supported a group's ability to prioritize information, to make comparisons between task data, and to form and critique the group's working hypothesis. Analyses of group performance revealed a positive correlation with equity of member participation using the shared digital table, and a negative correlation of equity of member participation using personal tablets. Implications for the support of sensemaking groups, and the use of equity of member participation as a predictive measure of their performance are discussed.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/acBPYCNuNz0?rel=0","title":"Collaborative sensemaking on a digital tabletop and personal tablets: prioritization, comparisons, and tableaux","filename":"CHI13/p3345","authors":["James R.
