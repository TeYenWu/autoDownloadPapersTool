This is in contrast with the approach of existing interfaces which visually separate these components. Our study, which compares L.IVE with existing popular video-based learning environments, suggests advantages in this integrated approach as compared to the separated approach in learning.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/XdY1GjHa3Ik?rel=0","title":"L.IVE: an integrated interactive video-based learning environment","filename":"CHI14/p3399","authors":["Toni-Jan Keith Palma Monserrat","Yawen Li","Shengdong Zhao","Xiang Cao"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
