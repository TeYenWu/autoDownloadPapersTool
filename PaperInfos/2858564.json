Drawing on interviews with 14 individuals with upper-limb loss and diverse experiences with prostheses, we find people not only choose to use and not use prosthesis throughout their lives but also form close and complex relationships with them. The design of \"assistive\" technology often focuses on enhancing function; however, we found that prostheses played important roles in people's development of identity and sense of normalcy. Even when a prosthesis failed functionally, such as was the case with 3D-printed prostheses created by an on-line open-source maker community (e-NABLE), we found people still praised the design and initiative because of the positive impacts on popular culture, identity, and community building. This work surfaces crucial questions about the role of design interventions in identity production, the promise of maker communities for accelerating innovation, and a broader definition of \"assistive\" technology.","title":"An Intimate Laboratory?: Prostheses as a Tool for Experimenting with Identity and Normalcy","filename":"CHI16/p1745","authors":["Cynthia L.
