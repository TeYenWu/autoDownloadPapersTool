{"paperId":2556356,"reference":[],"citation":[],"abstract":"This book brings to bear a body of logic synthesis techniques, in order to contribute to the analysis and control of Boolean Networks (BN) for modeling genetic diseases such as cancer. The authors provide several VLSI logic techniques to model the genetic disease behavior as a BN, with powerful implicit enumeration techniques. Coverage also includes techniques from VLSI testing to control a faulty BN, transforming its behavior to a healthy BN, potentially aiding in efforts to find the best candidates for treatment of genetic diseases.","title":"Logic Synthesis for Genetic Diseases: Modeling Disease Behavior Using Boolean Networks","authors":""}
