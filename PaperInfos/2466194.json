An embedded LCD presents dynamic information to the wearer and interaction is facilitated by sensing movement of the retractable string which attaches the unit to the wearer's belt. This form-factor makes it possible to interact using a single hand, providing lightweight and immediate access to a variety of information when it's not convenient to pick up, unlock and interact directly with a device like a smartphone. In this paper we present our prototype interactive badge, demonstrate the underlying technology and describe a number of usage scenarios and interaction techniques","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mN_J8s5HJ6o?rel=0","title":"An interactive belt-worn badge with a retractable string-based input mechanism","filename":"CHI13/p1465","authors":["Norman Pohl","Steve Hodges","John Helmes","Nicolas Villar","Tim Paek"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
