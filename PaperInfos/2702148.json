{"paperId":2702148,"citation":[],"abstract":"Foot positions are features of how humans express their intentions during conversations. This inspired us to investigate the usage of foot expressions during interactions with computers. We conducted an observational study to determine how foot positions correlate with the intentions of users at public displays. Using our findings, we performed a case study to demonstrate the usefulness of adapting content according to the intentions detected based on foot positions. Our results are valuable for researchers designing context-aware public displays.","reference":[{"content":"Till Ballendat , Nicolai Marquardt , Saul Greenberg, Proxemic interaction: designing for a proximity and orientation-aware environment, ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces, November 07-10, 2010, Saarbrücken, Germany","paperID":"1936676"},{"content":"Alan Bränzel , Christian Holz , Daniel Hoffmann , Dominik Schmidt , Marius Knaust , Patrick Lühne , René Meusel , Stephan Richter , Patrick Baudisch, GravitySpace: tracking users and their poses in a smart room using a pressure-sensing floor, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 27-May 02, 2013, Paris, France","paperID":"2470757"},{"content":"Brignull, H., and Rogers, Y.
