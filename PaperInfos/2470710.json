However, covering all possible user behaviors with one UI is a complex challenge. The Scenario-based Interactive UI Design tool is designed to support the characterization of user behavior based on scenarios and then using the information in UI design. Scenarios make it easy to understand and share user behavior even if we have little design knowledge. However, they have two big weaknesses; 1) integrating several scenarios in one UI is difficult, even if we can create appropriate scenarios, 2) maintaining the links between scenarios and the UI is a heavy task in iterative design. Our tool solves the above problems through its hierarchical scenario structure and visualized overview of scenarios. It enhances the designer's skill in writing scenarios and designing UIs smoothly and easily.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/AcbdwOjy7Zc?rel=0","title":"Scenario-based interactive UI design","filename":"CHI13/p391","authors":["Koki Kusano","Momoko Nakatani","Takehiko Ohno"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
