However, at present sustained use and perceived value of civic engagement technologies remains low because the design space is poorly understood by system developers who focus almost exclusively on empowering citizens rather than adopting an informed, inclusive approach that addresses the needs of both citizens and civic authorities, and helps establish trusted relationships between these different stakeholders. We report on an extensive study of civic engagement in the domain of public infrastructure maintenance and provide insights into the civic management processes to support future design of trusted civic engagement interactions.","title":"HCI, Civic Engagement & Trust","filename":"CHI15/p2833","authors":["Mike Harding","Bran Knowles","Nigel Davies","Mark Rouncefield"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
