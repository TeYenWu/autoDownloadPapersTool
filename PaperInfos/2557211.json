This paper describes an experiment in which users make decisions assisted by recommendations of a DSS in a fantasy baseball game. This experiment shows that the act of customizing a DSS can lead to biased decision making. I show that users who believe they have customized a DSS's recommendation algorithm are more likely to follow the recommendations regardless of their accuracy. I also show that this customization bias is the result of using a DSS to seek confirmatory information in a recommendation.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/d11gS_Zl_Is?rel=0","title":"Customization bias in decision support systems","filename":"CHI14/p3065","authors":["Jacob Solomon"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
