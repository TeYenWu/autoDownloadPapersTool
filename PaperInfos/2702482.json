{"paperId":2702482,"citation":[],"abstract":"We have conducted interviews with ten elite and recreational athletes to understand their experiences and engagement with endurance sport and personal and wearable sports technology. The athletes emphasized the experiential aspects of doing sports and the notion of feeling was repeatedly used to talk about their activities. Technology played both an instrumental role in measuring performance and feeding bio-data back to them, and an experiential role in supporting and enhancing the sport experience. To guide further interaction design research in the sports domain, we suggest two interrelated ways of looking at sports performances and experiences, firstly through the notion of a measured sense of performance, and secondly as a lived-sense of performance.","reference":[{"content":"Aino Ahtinen , Pertti Huuskonen , Jonna Häkkilä, Let's all get up and walk to the North Pole: design and evaluation of a mobile wellness application, Proceedings of the 6th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction: Extending Boundaries, October 16-20, 2010, Reykjavik, Iceland","paperID":"1868920"},{"content":"Aino Ahtinen , Minna Isomursu , Muzayun Mukhtar , Jani Mäntyjärvi , Jonna Häkkilä , Jan Blom, Designing social features for mobile and ubiquitous wellness applications, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia, p.1-10, November 22-25, 2009, Cambridge, United Kingdom","paperID":"1658562"},{"content":"Dominik Bial , Thorsten Appelmann , Enrico Rukzio , Albrecht Schmidt, Improving cyclists training with tactile feedback on feet, Proceedings of the 7th international conference on Haptic and Audio Interaction Design, August 23-24, 2012, Lund, Sweden","paperID":"2369009"},{"content":"Ed H.
