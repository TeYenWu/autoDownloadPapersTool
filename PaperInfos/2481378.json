Simple living refers to a lifestyle which is voluntarily simple out of concern for both the environment and quality of life. Our goal was to learn about a holistic view on sustainability and the role of ICT in helping and hindering families to live simply. The study contributes new insights about how holistic sustainability could be a valuable lens for HCI, revealing that sustainability is important to a wider range of areas in HCI than previously discussed. We conclude with implications for HCI for how to support sustainable practices beyond being \"about\" being green.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/z1RwMHA5qUQ?rel=0","title":"Beyond being green: simple living families and ICT","filename":"CHI13/p2725","authors":["Maria Håkansson","Phoebe Sengers"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
