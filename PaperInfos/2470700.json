{"paperId":2470700,"abstract":"New mothers can experience social exclusion, particularly during the early weeks when infants are solely dependent on their mothers. We used ethnographic methods to investigate whether technology plays a role in supporting new mothers. Our research identified two core themes: (1) the need to improve confidence as a mother; and (2) the need to be more than \\'18just' a mother. We reflect on these findings both in terms of those interested in designing applications and services for motherhood and also the wider CHI community.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Tv62GDsGFyg?rel=0","citation":[{"content":"Anouk Wierckx , Suleman Shahid , Abdullah Al Mahmud, Babywijzer: an application to support women during their pregnancy, CHI '14 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 26-May 01, 2014, Toronto, Ontario, Canada","paperID":"2581179"},{"content":"Michael Massimi , Svetlana Yarosh , Madeline E.
