SurfaceLink uses a combination of on-device accelerometers, vibration motors, speakers and microphones (and, optionally, an off-device contact microphone for greater sensitivity) to sense gestures performed on the shared surface. In a controlled evaluation with 10 participants, SurfaceLink detected the presence of devices on the same surface with 97.7% accuracy, their relative arrangement with 89.4% accuracy, and various single- and multi-touch surface gestures with an average accuracy of 90.3%. A usability analysis showed that SurfaceLink has advantages over current multi-device interaction techniques in a number of situations.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/rQ7OjpYqocs?rel=0","title":"SurfaceLink: using inertial and acoustic sensing to enable multi-device interaction on a surface","filename":"CHI14/p1387","authors":["Mayank Goel","Brendan Lee","Md.
