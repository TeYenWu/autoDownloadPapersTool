We present a set of guidelines for movement-based game design that has emerged from our research-based game development practice. These guidelines have been examined and refined by 14 movement-based game design experts with experience in the academic, independent and commercial game development domains. We contextualize the guidelines using current findings about movement-based game and interaction design, taken from both published research papers and game design venues. Our primary contribution is a body of generative intermediate-level knowledge in the design research tradition that is readily accessible and actionable for the design of future movement-based games.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/oOi16WkCZoE?rel=0","title":"Movement-based game guidelines","filename":"CHI14/p2191","authors":["Florian Mueller","Katherine Isbister"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
