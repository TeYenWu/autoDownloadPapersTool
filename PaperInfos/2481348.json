We worked in the context of a women's centre where women are accessing support after leaving abusive relationships. The paper contributes a feminist participatory arts action research approach to studying photo-sharing practices and helps to frame an understanding of the ongoing tensions in the construction of self with others that the women experience. We argue that the affirmation of new bonds, control in sharing the process of 'moving on', and supporting discursive negotiations of privacy are important considerations for design focused on interpersonal social processes around the use of digital technology.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/HY6fG9HZoaY?rel=0","title":"Digital portraits: photo-sharing after domestic violence","filename":"CHI13/p2517","authors":["Rachel Clarke","Peter Wright","Madeline Balaam","John McCarthy"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
