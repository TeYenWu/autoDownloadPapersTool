However, existing interaction techniques have limitations when manipulating large data sets. Our goal is to define novel interaction techniques for multi-touch and tangible interfaces, which support the construction of complex queries for big data. In this paper, we present results from a study which investigates the use of gestural interaction with active tokens for manipulating large data sets. In particular, we studied user expectations of a hybrid tangible and gestural language engaging this space. Our main results include a vocabulary of user-defined gestures for interaction with active tokens, which extends beyond familiar multi-touch gestures; characterization of the design space of gestural interaction with active tokens; and insight into participants' mental models, including common metaphors. We also present implications for the design of multi-touch and tangible interfaces with active tokens.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ICLzTqs5G20?rel=0","title":"Exploring the design space of gestural interaction with active tokens through user-defined gestures","filename":"CHI14/p4107","authors":["Consuelo Valdes","Diana Eastman","Casey Grote","Shantanu Thatte","Orit Shaer","Ali Mazalek","Brygg Ullmer","Miriam K.
