With BeThere, we explore 3D gestures and spatial input which allow remote users to perform a variety of virtual interactions in a local user's physical environment. Our system is completely self-contained and uses depth sensors to track the location of a user's fingers as well as to capture the 3D shape of objects in front of the sensor. We illustrate the unique capabilities of our system through a series of interactions that allow users to control and manipulate 3D virtual content. We also provide qualitative feedback from a preliminary user study which confirmed that users can complete a shared collaborative task using our system.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/M1T1Xlk0irE?rel=0","title":"BeThere: 3D mobile collaboration with spatial input","filename":"CHI13/p179","authors":["Rajinder S.
