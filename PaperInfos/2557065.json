There are clearly design features that could greatly improve accuracy in entering numbers but the context of the task could also play an important role. In particular, the emotional state of a person is known to strongly influence their response to a difficult situation and hence the errors that they make. In this paper, we consider the impact of the emotional state of the user on the accuracy with which people enter numbers. Our experiment shows that participants who are in a more positive emotional state are more accurate. The effect is small but could be very important when considering the potentially highly-charged emotional contexts where many healthcare devices are used.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Q9W3g_I2AKk?rel=0","title":"The influence of emotion on number entry errors","filename":"CHI14/p2293","authors":["Paul Cairns","Pratyush Pandab","Christopher Power"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
