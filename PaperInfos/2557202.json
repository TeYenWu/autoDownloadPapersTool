Q&A sites have emerged as an efficient way to address questions in various domains by leveraging crowd knowledge. However, they lack sufficient reliability to be the sole basis of customer service applications. We built a proof-of-concept mixed-initiative tool that helps a crowd-manager to decide if a question will get a satisfactory and timely answer by the crowd or if it should be redirected to a dedicated operator. A user experiment found that our tool reduced the participants' cognitive load and improved their performance, in terms of their precision and recall. In particular, those with higher performance benefited more than those with lower performance.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/-TUvNsPDGS8?rel=0","title":"Towards crowd-based customer service: a mixed-initiative tool for managing Q&A sites","filename":"CHI14/p2725","authors":["Tiziano Piccardi","Gregorio Convertino","Massimo Zancanaro","Ji Wang","Cedric Archambeau"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
