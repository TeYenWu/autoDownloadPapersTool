In this paper we investigate mechanisms for enticing interaction on public displays, and study the effectiveness of visual signals in overcoming the 'first click' problem. We combined 3 atomic visual elements (color/greyscale, animation/static, and icon/text) to form 8 visual signals that were deployed on 8 interactive public displays on a university campus for 8 days. Our findings show that text is more effective in enticing interaction than icons, color more than greyscale, and static signals are more effective than animated. Further, we identify gender differences in the effectiveness of these signals. Finally, we identify a behavior termed \"display avoidance\" that people exhibit with interactive public displays.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/S9w-sfrGuv8?rel=0","title":"What makes you click: exploring visual signals to entice interaction on public displays","filename":"CHI13/p1699","authors":["Hannu Kukka","Heidi Oja","Vassilis Kostakos","Jorge Gonçalves","Timo Ojala"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
