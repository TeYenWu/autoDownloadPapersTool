{"paperId":2858397,"citation":[],"abstract":"The increase in the availability of personal genomic data to lay consumers using online services poses a challenge to HCI researchers: such data are complex and sensitive, involve multiple dimensions of uncertainty, and can have substantial implications for individuals' well-being. Personal genomic data are also unique because unlike other personal data, which constantly change, genomic data are largely stable during a person's lifetime; it is their interpretation and implications that change over time as new medical research exposes relationships between genes and health. In this paper, we present a novel tool for self exploration of personal genomic data. To evaluate the usability and utility of the tool, we conducted the first study of a genome interpretation tool to date, in which users used their own personal genomic data. We conclude by offering design implications for the development of interactive personal genomic reports.","reference":[{"content":"Peter W Airasian, Kathleen A Cruikshank, Richard E Mayer, PR Pintrich, James Raths and Merlin C Wittrock. 2001.
