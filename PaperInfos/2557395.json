The differential value given to expert versus lay knowledge is a central factor in these debates. We apply Artifact Analysis, developed to help designers handle the complexity of digital artifacts, as a method to explore how experts and non-experts understand and frame robots, a technology characterized by significant complexity. Our results show that both non-expert users and expert researchers have knowledge that is significant to future robot development, but they focus on different aspects of the technology - users address mediated and interaction complexity while researchers focus on internal and external complexity. We also found that robots function as boundary objects between experts and users, and suggest that one task designers can perform is to \"stay on the boundary\" and mediate between the different ways in which experts and non-experts frame emerging technology to develop designs that benefit from insights from both user and researcher perspectives.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/DN11GRhBC6I?rel=0","title":"Stay on the boundary: artifact analysis exploring researcher and user framing of robot design","filename":"CHI14/p1471","authors":["Hee Rin Lee","Selma Å abanovic","Erik Stolterman"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
