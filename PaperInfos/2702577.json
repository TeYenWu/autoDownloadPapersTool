We followed an iterative design process, trialling a first version of the app with 20 people and a second version with 31. The trials were conducted in the wild, on users' own devices. The second version of the app enforced a turn-taking system that meant only one member of a group of users could track their activity at any one time. This constrained tracking at the individual level, but more successfully led users to communicate and interact with each other. We discuss the second trial with reference to two concepts: social-relatedness and individual-competence. We discuss six key lessons from the trial, and identify two high-level design implications: attend to \"practices\" of tracking; and look within and beyond \"collaboration\" and \"competition\" in the design of activity trackers.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/YPXfkwJo4Ns?rel=0","title":"Pass the Ball: Enforced Turn-Taking in Activity Tracking","filename":"CHI15/p2417","authors":["John Rooksby","Mattias Rost","Alistair Morrison","Matthew Chalmers"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
