This paper investigates the relationship between such characteristics and fine-grained user attention patterns. In particular, we present results from an eye tracking user study involving bar graphs and radar graphs, showing that a user's cognitive abilities such as perceptual speed and verbal working memory have a significant impact on gaze behavior, both in general and in relation to task difficulty and visualization type. These results are discussed in view of our long-term goal of designing information visualisation systems that can dynamically adapt to individual user characteristics.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/VTh890R2vfI?rel=0","title":"Individual user characteristics and information visualization: connecting the dots through eye tracking","filename":"CHI13/p295","authors":["Dereck Toker","Cristina Conati","Ben Steichen","Giuseppe Carenini"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
