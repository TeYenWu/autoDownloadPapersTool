While this division is ergonomically superior to simple direct-touch displays for many tasks, users are no longer looking at their hands when touching. This requires the system to support an intermediate \\'1ctracking\\'1d state that lets users aim at objects without triggering a selection, similar to the hover state in mouse-based UIs. We present an empirical analysis of several interaction techniques for indirect touch systems to switch to this intermediate state, and derive design recommendations for incorporating it into such systems.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ro4CvcSwncQ?rel=0","title":"An evaluation of state switching methods for indirect touch systems","filename":"CHI13/p745","authors":["Simon Voelker","Chat Wacharamanotham","Jan Borchers"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
