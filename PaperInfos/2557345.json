Whilst there is substantial work on innovative controllers for consoles, like the XBox Kinect, relatively little has been done to understand the effect of the different control mechanisms that can be used to play games on mobile devices like smartphones. A well-defined framework of naturalness has emerged as potentially useful concept in area of game controllers. This paper reports two experiments that look at how the naturalness of the game controls influences the experience of immersion in mobile games. It seems that where there is an a prior natural mapping, this will improve immersion in the game but in the absence of a prior mapping, naturalness alone is not sufficient to account for immersion. This opens up the need for a more thorough investigation of this area.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/0fCH3QJrmmA?rel=0","title":"The influence of controllers on immersion in mobile games","filename":"CHI14/p371","authors":["Paul Cairns","Jing Li","Wendy Wang","A.
