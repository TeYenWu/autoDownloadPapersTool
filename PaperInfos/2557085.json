{"paperId":2557085,"abstract":"With the increasing popularity of mainstream wearable devices, it is critical to assess the accessibility implications of such technologies. For people with visual impairments, who do not always need the visual display of a mobile phone, alternative means of eyes-free wearable interaction are particularly appealing. To explore the potential impacts of such technology, we conducted two studies. The first was an online survey that included 114 participants with visual impairments and 101 sighted participants; we compare the two groups in terms of current device use. The second was an interview and design probe study with 10 participants with visual impairments. Our findings expand on past work to characterize a range of trends in smartphone use and accessibility issues therein. Participants with visual impairments also responded positively to two eyes-free wearable device scenarios: a wristband or ring and a glasses-based device. Discussions on projected use of these devices suggest that small, easily accessible, and discreet wearable input could positively impact the ability of people with visual impairments to access information on the go and to participate in certain social interactions.","citation":[{"content":"Hsuan-Eng Chen , Yi-Ying Lin , Chien-Hsing Chen , I-Fang Wang, BlindNavi: A Navigation App for the Visually Impaired Smartphone User, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 18-23, 2015, Seoul, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2726953"},{"content":"Alexander Fiannaca , Ilias Apostolopoulous , Eelke Folmer, Headlock: a wearable navigation aid that helps blind cane users traverse large open spaces, Proceedings of the 16th international ACM SIGACCESS conference on Computers & accessibility, October 20-22, 2014, Rochester, New York, USA","paperID":"2661344"},{"content":"Alexander Fiannaca , Ilias Apostolopoulous , Eelke Folmer, Headlock: a wearable navigation aid that helps blind cane users traverse large open spaces, Proceedings of the 16th international ACM SIGACCESS conference on Computers & accessibility, October 20-22, 2014, Rochester, New York, USA","paperID":"2661453"},{"content":"Charlotte Magnusson , Bitte Rydeman , Sara Finocchietti , Giulia Cappagli , Lope Ben Porquis , Gabriel Baud-Bovy , Monica Gori, Co-located games created by children with visual impairments, Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services Adjunct, August 24-27, 2015, Copenhagen, Denmark","paperID":"2794350"},{"content":"Pinata Winoto , Tiffany Y.
