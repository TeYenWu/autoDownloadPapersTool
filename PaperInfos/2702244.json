{"paperId":2702244,"abstract":"We present the design and evaluation of the Roly-Poly Mouse (RPM), a rolling input device that combines the advantages of the mouse (position displacement) and of 3D devices (roll and rotation) to unify 2D and 3D interaction. Our first study explores RPM gesture amplitude and stability for different upper shapes (Hemispherical, Convex) and hand postures. 8 roll directions can be performed precisely and their amplitude is larger on Hemispherical RPM. As minor rolls affect translation, we propose a roll correction algorithm to support stable 2D pointing with RPM. We propose the use of compound gestures for 3D pointing and docking, and evaluate them against a commercial 3D device, the SpaceMouse. Our studies reveal that RPM performs 31% faster than the SpaceMouse for 3D pointing and equivalently for 3D rotation. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept integrated RPM prototype along with discussion on the various technical challenges to overcome to build a final integrated version of RPM.","citation":[],"reference":[{"content":"Ravin Balakrishnan , Thomas Baudel , Gordon Kurtenbach , George Fitzmaurice, The Rockin'Mouse: integral 3D manipulation on a plane, Proceedings of the ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human factors in computing systems, p.311-318, March 22-27, 1997, Atlanta, Georgia, USA","paperID":"258778"},{"content":"Hrvoje Benko , Shahram Izadi , Andrew D.
