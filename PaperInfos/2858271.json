{"paperId":2858271,"citation":[],"abstract":"In this paper, we present an off-the-shelf UX evaluation tool which contextualizes users' physiological and behavioral signals while interacting with a system. The proposed tool triangulates users' gaze data with inferred users' cognitive and emotional states to produce user experience (UX) heatmaps, which show where users were looking when they experienced specific cognitive and emotional states. Results show that for a given cognitive state (i.e., cognitive load), the proposed UX heatmap was able to effectively highlight the areas where users experienced different levels of cognitive load on an interface. The proposed tool enables the visual analysis of users' various emotional and cognitive states for specific areas on a given interface, and also to compare users' states across multiple interfaces, which should be useful for both UX researchers and practitioners.","reference":[{"content":"Benedetto, S., Pedrotti, M., Minin, L., Baccino, T., Re, A. and Montanari, R. 2011.
