During the information-seeking process, users often revisit previously viewed locations, repeat earlier searches, or need to memorize or manually mark areas of interest. To facilitate rapid returns to earlier views during map exploration, we propose a novel algorithm to automatically generate map bookmarks based on a user's interaction. TrailMap, a web application based on this algorithm, is developed, providing a fluid and effective neighborhood exploration experience. A one-week study is conducted to evaluate TrailMap in users' everyday web browsing activities. Results showed that TrailMap's implicit bookmarking mechanism is efficient for map exploration and the interactive and visual nature of the tool is intuitive to users.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/M6zsVJubw04?rel=0","title":"TrailMap: facilitating information seeking in a multi-scale digital map via implicit bookmarking","filename":"CHI13/p3009","authors":["Jian Zhao","Daniel Wigdor","Ravin Balakrishnan"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
