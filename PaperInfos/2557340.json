Physical controls have the advantage of exploiting people's innate abilities for manipulating physical objects in the real world. We designed and implemented a prototype, called Paddle, to demonstrate our concept. Additionally, we explore the interaction techniques enabled by this concept and conduct an in-depth study to evaluate our transformable physical controls. Our findings show that these physical controls provide several benefits over traditional touch interaction techniques commonly used on mobile devices.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/piKBDjyYpW0?rel=0","title":"Paddle: highly deformable mobile devices with physical controls","filename":"CHI14/p2569","authors":["Raf Ramakers","Johannes Schöning","Kris Luyten"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
