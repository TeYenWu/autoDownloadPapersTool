AutoGami has hardware and software components that allow users to design and implement automated movable paper craft without any prerequisite knowledge of electronics; it also supports rapid prototyping. Apart from developing the toolkit, we have analyzed the design space of movable paper craft and developed a taxonomy to facilitate the design of automated paper craft. AutoGami made consistently strong showings in design workshops, confirming its viability in supporting engagement and creativity as well as its usability in storytelling through paper craft. Additional highlights include rapid prototyping of product design as well as interaction design such as human-robot interactions.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/M61TJksEJwg?rel=0","title":"AutoGami: a low-cost rapid prototyping toolkit for automated movable paper craft","filename":"CHI13/p661","authors":["Kening Zhu","Shengdong Zhao"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
