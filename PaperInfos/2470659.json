Using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we identify topics from more than half a million Facebook status updates and determine which topics are more likely to receive feedback, such as likes and comments. Women tend to share more personal topics (e.g., family matters), while men discuss more public ones (e.g., politics and sports). Generally, women receive more feedback than men, but \"male\" topics (those more often posted by men) receive more feedback, especially when posted by women.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/FNqeqldK6aQ?rel=0","title":"Gender, topic, and audience response: an analysis of user-generated content on facebook","filename":"CHI13/p31","authors":["Yi-Chia Wang","Moira Burke","Robert E.
