{"paperId":2557170,"abstract":"The proliferation of inexpensive connected devices has created a situation where a person, at any given moment, is surrounded by interactive computers. Despite this fact, there are very few means by which a user may take advantage of this large number of screens. We present Conductor, a prototype framework which serves as an exemplar for the construction of cross-device applications. We present a series of interaction methods by which users can easily share information, chain tasks across devices, and manage sessions across devices. We also present a cross-device usage scenario which utilizes several cross-device applications built within our prototype framework. We also describe a user study, which helped us to understand how users will take advantage of a large number of devices in support of performance of a sense making task.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/H2NZKqmdMFo?rel=0","title":"Conductor: enabling and understanding cross-device interaction","filename":"CHI14/p2773","authors":["Peter Hamilton","Daniel J.
