However, there is limited research that looks into the effects that sharing biometric data with others could have on one's social network. Following a period of research on existing mobile applications and prototype testing, we developed a system, HeartLink, which collects real-time personal biometric data such as heart rate and broadcasts this data online. Insights gained on designing systems to broadcast real-time biometric data are presented. In this paper we also report emerging results from testing HeartLink in a pilot study and a user study that were conducted during sport events. The results showed that sharing heart rate data does influence the relationship of the persons involved and that the degree of influence seems related to the tie strength prior to visualizing the data.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/tLoDVvelNoo?rel=0","citation":[{"content":"Wouter Walmink , Danielle Wilde , Florian 'Floyd' Mueller, Displaying heart rate data on a bicycle helmet to support social exertion experiences, Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction, February 16-19, 2014, Munich, Germany","paperID":"2540970"},{"content":"Kristina Knaving , Paweł Wózniak, TickTockRun: Towards Enhancing Communication in Runner Families, Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing Companion, February 26-March 02, 2016, San Francisco, California, USA","paperID":"2869114"},{"content":"Takumi Shirokura , Nagisa Munekata , Tetsuo Ono, AffectiView: mobile video camera application using physiological data, Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Mobile and Ubiquitous Multimedia, December 02-05, 2013, Luleå, Sweden","paperID":"2541855"},{"content":"Rohit Ashok Khot , Jeewon Lee , Larissa Hjorth , Florian 'Floyd' Mueller, TastyBeats: Celebrating Heart Rate Data with a Drinkable Spectacle, Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction, January 15-19, 2015, Stanford, California, USA","paperID":"2680545"},{"content":"Franco Curmi , Maria Angela Ferrario , Jon Whittle, Sharing real-time biometric data across social networks: requirements for research experiments, Proceedings of the 2014 conference on Designing interactive systems, June 21-25, 2014, Vancouver, BC, Canada","paperID":"2598515"},{"content":"Franco Curmi , Maria Angela Ferrario , Jon Whittle, BioShare: a research tool for analyzing social networks effects when sharing biometric data, Proceedings of the 2014 companion publication on Designing interactive systems, June 21-25, 2014, Vancouver, BC, Canada","paperID":"2602793"},{"content":"Anton Fedosov , Marc Langheinrich, From Start to Finish: Understanding Group Sharing Behavior in a Backcountry Skiing Community, Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services Adjunct, August 24-27, 2015, Copenhagen, Denmark","paperID":"2793698"},{"content":"Kristina Knaving , Paweł Woźniak , Morten Fjeld , Staffan Björk, Flow is Not Enough: Understanding the Needs of Advanced Amateur Runners to Design Motivation Technology, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 18-23, 2015, Seoul, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2702542"},{"content":"Paweł Woźniak , Kristina Knaving , Staffan Björk , Morten Fjeld, RUFUS: Remote Supporter Feedback for Long-Distance Runners, Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services, August 24-27, 2015, Copenhagen, Denmark","paperID":"2785893"},{"content":"Jakob Tholander , Stina Nylander, Snot, Sweat, Pain, Mud, and Snow: Performance and Experience in the Use of Sports Watches, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 18-23, 2015, Seoul, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2702482"},{"content":"Kim Oakes , Katie A.
