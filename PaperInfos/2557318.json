The design aimed at critical reflection and inspiration among users, rather than achieving a certain kind of persuasion. This guided the practical design to be modelled around open-endedness and social voices to challenge ideas and points of view. We argue that research addressing design for interactions about value-laden concepts such as sustainable action need to find ways of supporting various knowledge discourses, by distinguishing between performative and representational technologies. The approach allowed us to identify a number of design challenges regarding interactive technology and interaction design in relation to aspects of knowledge and truth, trust, negotiation and responsibility.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/NMP4LD5G4iM?rel=0","title":"Performativity in sustainable interaction: the case of seasonal grocery shopping in ecofriends","filename":"CHI14/p271","authors":["Maria Normark","Jakob Tholander"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
