Qualitative studies have observed this activity being performed with multiple browser windows or tabs. However, these solutions are not satisfying since a large amount of time is wasted on switch among windows and tabs. In this paper, we propose the multiple-page view to facilitate parallel web browsing. Specifically, we provide users with the experience of visiting multiple web pages in one browser window and tab with extensions of prevalent desktop web browsers. Through user study and survey, we found that 2-4 pages within the window size were preferred for multiple-page view in spite of the diverse screen sizes and resolutions. Analytical results of logs from the user study also showed an improvement of 26.3% in users' efficiency of performing parallel web browsing tasks, compared to traditional browsing with multiple windows or tabs.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/uLbp_dy76dc?rel=0","title":"Facilitating parallel web browsing through multiple-page view","filename":"CHI13/p2167","authors":["Wenchang Xu","Chun Yu","Songmin Zhao","Jie Liu","Yuanchun Shi"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
