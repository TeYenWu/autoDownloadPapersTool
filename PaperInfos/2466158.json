To develop a richer characterization of use, we turned to a previously untapped source of data: YouTube videos. We collected and analyzed 187 non-commercial videos uploaded to YouTube that depicted a person with a physical disability interacting with a mainstream mobile touchscreen device. We coded the videos along a range of dimensions to characterize the interaction, the challenges encountered, and the adaptations being adopted in daily use. To complement the video data, we also invited the video uploaders to complete a survey on their ongoing use of touchscreen technology. Our findings show that, while many people with motor impairments find these devices empowering, accessibility issues still exist. In addition to providing implications for more accessible touchscreen design, we reflect on the application of user-generated content to study user interface design.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/CcusUm_6r7o?rel=0","citation":[{"content":"Yoojin Kim , Nita Sutreja , Jon Froehlich , Leah Findlater, Surveying the accessibility of touchscreen games for persons with motor impairments: a preliminary analysis, Proceedings of the 15th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility, October 21-23, 2013, Bellevue, Washington","paperID":"2513416"},{"content":"Silvia Lovato , Anne Marie Piper, \"Siri, is this you?\": Understanding young children's interactions with voice input systems, Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Interaction Design and Children, p.335-338, June 21-24, 2015, Boston, Massachusetts","paperID":"2771910"},{"content":"Kyle Montague , André Rodrigues , Hugo Nicolau , Tiago Guerreiro, TinyBlackBox: Supporting Mobile In-The-Wild Studies, Proceedings of the 17th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers & Accessibility, October 26-28, 2015, Lisbon, Portugal","paperID":"2811379"},{"content":"Meethu Malu , Leah Findlater, \"OK Glass?\"  A Preliminary Exploration of Google Glass for Persons with Upper Body Motor Impairments, Proceedings of the 16th international ACM SIGACCESS conference on Computers & accessibility, October 20-22, 2014, Rochester, New York, USA","paperID":"2661400"},{"content":"Tiago Guerreiro , Kyle Montague , João Guerreiro , Rafael Nunes , Hugo Nicolau , Daniel J.V.
