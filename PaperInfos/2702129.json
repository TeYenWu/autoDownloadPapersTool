We demonstrate the idea of SketchSliders, range sliders that users can freely sketch on a mobile surface to customize their exploration. A small combination of sketches and gestures allows the creation of complex interactive sliders, such as circular sliders for periodic data, slider branches for detailed interaction, and fisheye transformation sliders. We augment sliders with a suite of tools, such as markers, slider cursors, and approximate views of data distributions. Our designs are inspired by a design study with three visualization experts and validated through a user study with six experts using our system. Our findings indicate that our sketching interface accommodates a wide range of exploration strategies, helping users customize as well as focus their visual explorations.","title":"SketchSliders: Sketching Widgets for Visual Exploration on Wall Displays","filename":"CHI15/p3255","authors":["Theophanis Tsandilas","Anastasia Bezerianos","Thibaut Jacob"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
