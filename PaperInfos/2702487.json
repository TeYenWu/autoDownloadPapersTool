With PaperPulse, designers overlay pre-designed visual elements with widgets available in our design tool. PaperPulse provides designers with three families of widgets designed for smooth integration with paper, for an overall of 20 different interactive components. We also contribute a logic demonstration and recording approach, Pulsation, that allows for specifying functional relationships between widgets. Using the final design and the recorded Pulsation logic, PaperPulse generates layered electronic circuit designs, and code that can be deployed on a microcontroller. By following automatically generated assembly instructions, designers can seamlessly integrate the microcontroller and widgets in the final paper artifact.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/sTuc4joTDPI?rel=0","title":"PaperPulse: An Integrated Approach for Embedding Electronics in Paper Designs","filename":"CHI15/p2457","authors":["Raf Ramakers","Kashyap Todi","Kris Luyten"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
