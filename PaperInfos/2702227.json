Studies have shown cognitive benefits for a vertical peephole orientation, when compared to non-egocentric interaction styles. To see how the aspect of canvas orientation effects user performance, we conducted a study (N=16) which revealed that canvas orientation has no significant effect on either navigation performance or spatial memory. We also found a significantly lower physical demand and a higher mental demand in the horizontal orientation. For short-term activities we therefore propose a vertical orientation, while for long-term activities horizontal dynamic peephole navigation is more suitable.","title":"An Experimental Comparison of Vertical and Horizontal Dynamic Peephole Navigation","filename":"CHI15/p1523","authors":["Jens Müller","Roman Rädle","Hans-Christian Jetter","Harald Reiterer"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
