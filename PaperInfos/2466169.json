It accommodates HCI scenarios involving continuous movement of multiple limbs. Throughput is calculated as mutual information in repeated motor sequences. It is affected by the complexity of movements and the precision with which an actor reproduces them. Computation requires decorrelating co-dependencies of movement features (e.g., wrist and elbow) and temporal alignment of sequences. HCI researchers can use the metric as an analysis tool when designing and studying user interfaces.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/yOt-ZKAz3Yg?rel=0","title":"Information capacity of full-body movements","filename":"CHI13/p1289","authors":["Antti Oulasvirta","Teemu Roos","Arttu Modig","Laura Lepp√§nen"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
