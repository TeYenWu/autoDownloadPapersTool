{"paperId":2702409,"abstract":"Interruptions while driving can be quite dangerous, whether these are self-interruptions or external interruptions. They increase driver workload and reduce performance on the primary driving task. Being able to identify when a driver is interruptible is critical for building systems that can mediate these interruptions. In this paper, we collect sensor and human-annotated data from 15 drivers, including vehicle motion, traffic states, physiological responses and driver motion. We demonstrate that this data can be used to build a machine learning classifier that can determine interruptibility every second with a 94% accuracy. We present both population and individual models and discuss the features that contribute to the high performance of this system. Such a classifier can be used to build systems that mediate when drivers use technology to self-interrupt and when drivers are interrupted by technology.","citation":[{"content":"Andreas Braun , Sebastian Frank , Martin Majewski , Xiaofeng Wang, CapSeat: capacitive proximity sensing for automotive activity recognition, Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Automotive User Interfaces and Interactive Vehicular Applications, September 01-03, 2015, Nottingham, United Kingdom","paperID":"2799263"},{"content":"Rahul Rajan , Ted Selker , Ian Lane, Task Load Estimation and Mediation Using Psycho-physiological Measures, Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, March 07-10, 2016, Sonoma, California, USA","paperID":"2856769"},{"content":"Liam D.
