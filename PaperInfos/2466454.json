This paper reflects on this critical perspective and compares it with Habermas's critical perspective. I claim that the recent critiques of PT are grounded on a narrow and pessimistic concept of modernism, and that Habermas's works, rarely taken into account in the HCI community, can serve as an alternative lens for reflective analysis and design and can provide a foundation for justifying design decisions while realizing the unfulfilled potentials of PT. Beyond offering critical analysis and reflections, this paper contributes to the HCI field by calling attention to alternative reflective concepts and emerging relevant works.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/yIpczMKQmxo?rel=0","title":"Critical perspective on persuasive technology reconsidered","filename":"CHI13/p3327","authors":["Fahri Yetim"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
