This paper presents a full-lifecycle analysis of the Exhibit framework - an end-user tool which provides such functionality - to understand the needs, capabilities, and practices of this class of users. We include interviews, as well as analysis of over 1,800 visualizations and 200,000 web interactions with these visualizations. Our analysis reveals important findings about this user population which generalize to the task of providing better end-user structured content publication tools.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/pKNQ1ufebsU?rel=0","title":"End-users publishing structured information on the web: an observational study of what, why, and how","filename":"CHI14/p1265","authors":["Edward Benson","David R.
