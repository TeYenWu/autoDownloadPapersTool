While much previous work has focused on the measurement of student engagement or learning at a gross level, we argue that new methods are necessary for measuring the alignment of a game to its target learning goals at an appropriate level of detail to inform design decisions. We present a novel technique that we have employed to examine alignment in an open-ended educational game. The approach is based on examining how the game reacts to representative student solutions that do and do not obey target principles. We demonstrate this method using real student data and discuss how redesign might be informed by these techniques.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/hRCTCCbwUSw?rel=0","title":"Using extracted features to inform alignment-driven design ideas in an educational game","filename":"CHI14/p3329","authors":["Erik Harpstead","Christopher J.
