It discusses how the use of a board game may provide a) a safe research environment in which participants feel comfortable to share their thoughts and experiences in a group setting, and b) a tool to facilitate users to think about their needs regarding a future product. The use of the board game approach is illustrated by a case study in the context of developing a new train information system. The design of the board game that was used is described in detail, as well as how the game was used to elicit potential future experiences. A survey amongst the participants showed that the board game was appreciated as a surprising, pleasant and \"safe\" research method.","title":"Using Game Principles in UX Research: A Board Game for Eliciting Future User Needs","filename":"CHI15/p1225","authors":["Karin Slegers","Sanne Ruelens","Jorick Vissers","Pieter Duysburgh"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
