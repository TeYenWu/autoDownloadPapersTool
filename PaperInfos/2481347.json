{"paperId":2481347,"abstract":"For decades, HCI scholars have designed technology for the domestic space. Many of these systems aim to protect the home and its residents by requesting help from local authorities during emergency situations. While the use of these systems have been examined, few studies attempt to understand the behavior of potential offenders who can create such emergency situations (e.g., by attempting a burglary). This paper analyzes three panel sessions with 15 people who have been convicted of burglarizing homes, cars, and/or businesses. Participants describe in detail what they looked for when deciding to burglarize a home and what deterred them. Technologies such as security systems, alarms, and cameras do not dissuade burglars. Instead, evidence of neighborhood cohesion was named the strongest deterrent. This paper presents implications for designing technologies that will effectively discourage burglary and support citizen activism.","citation":[{"content":"Elizabeth Daly , Sheena Erete , Rosta Farzan , Gary Hsieh , Cliff Lampe , Claudia Lopez , Andres Monroy-Hernandez , Daniele Quercia , Raz Schwartz , Amy Voida, Supporting Cities, Neighborhoods, and Local Communities with Information and Communication Technologies, Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference Companion on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing, March 14-18, 2015, Vancouver, BC, Canada","paperID":"2685556"},{"content":"Christina A.
