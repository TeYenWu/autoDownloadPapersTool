We investigated whether the classic think-aloud and a think-aloud with an explicit instruction leads to different task-solving performance compared to silent working. The results suggest that the classic method had no impact on task performance whereas the explicit instruction led to an increase in within-page and between-page navigation and scrolling activity. The classic method was linked to an increase in mental workload in terms of effort and frustration. The explicit think-aloud led to an increase in mental demand, performance, effort and frustration.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/hutBI8jZlHY?rel=0","title":"The effect of global instructions on think-aloud testing","filename":"CHI13/p2941","authors":["Sharon McDonald","Helen Petrie"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
