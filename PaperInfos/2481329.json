We observed that the presence of meters yielded significantly stronger passwords. We performed a followup field experiment to test a different scenario: creating a password for an unimportant account. In this scenario, we found that the meters made no observable difference: participants simply reused weak passwords that they used to protect similar low-risk accounts. We conclude that meters result in stronger passwords when users are forced to change existing passwords on \"important\" accounts and that individual meter design decisions likely have a marginal impact.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/NSWQnYqRxSk?rel=0","title":"Does my password go up to eleven?: the impact of password meters on password selection","filename":"CHI13/p2379","authors":["Serge Egelman","Andreas Sotirakopoulos","Ildar Muslukhov","Konstantin Beznosov","Cormac Herley"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
