The network is heavily structured by language with most mentions and retweets directed to users writing in the same language. Users writing in multiple languages are more active, authoring more tweets than monolingual users. These multilingual users play an important bridging role in the global connectivity of the network. The mean level of insularity from speakers in each language does not correlate straightforwardly with the size of the user base as predicted by previous research. Finally, the English language does play more of a bridging role than other languages, but the role played collectively by multilingual users across different languages is the largest bridging force in the network.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/rlUUB76mNAA?rel=0","title":"Global connectivity and multilinguals in the Twitter network","filename":"CHI14/p833","authors":["Scott A.
