In this paper, we describe EnviroPulse-a system for auto-matically determining and communicating the expected affective valence (EAV) of environments to individuals. We describe a prototype that allows this to be used in real-time on a smartphone, but EnviroPulse could easily be incorporated into GPS systems, mapping services, or image-based systems. Our work differs from existing work in af-fective computing in that, rather than detecting a user's affect directly, we automatically determine the EAV of the environment through visual analysis. We present results that suggest our system can determine the EAV of envi-ronments. We also introduce real-time affective visual feedback of the calculated EAV of the images, and present results from an informal study suggesting that real-time visual feedback can be used for induction of affect.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/HgiwXWmU-u8?rel=0","title":"EnviroPulse: Providing Feedback about the Expected Affective Valence of the Environment","filename":"CHI15/p2073","authors":["Deltcho Valtchanov","Mark Hancock"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
