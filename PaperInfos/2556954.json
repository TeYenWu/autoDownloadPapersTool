Compared with existing gamified software tutorial systems, CADament generates engaging learning experience through competitions. We investigate two variations of our game, where over-the-shoulder learning was simulated by providing viewports into other player's screens. We introduce an empirical lab study methodology where participants compete with one another, and we study knowledge transfer effects by tracking the migration of strategies between players during the study session. Our study shows that CADament has an advantage over pre-authored tutorials for improving learners' performance, increasing motivation, and stimulating knowledge transfer.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ls_9j7Akr1w?rel=0","title":"CADament: a gamified multiplayer software tutorial system","filename":"CHI14/p3369","authors":["Wei Li","Tovi Grossman","George Fitzmaurice"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
