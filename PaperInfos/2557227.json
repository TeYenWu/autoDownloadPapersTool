Members of the public are turning to these solutions to seek and offer emergency information. Emergency responders are working to determine what social media policies should be in terms of their \"public information\" functions. We report on the online communications from all the coastal fire and police departments within a 100 mile radius of Hurricane Sandy's US landfall. Across four types of online communication media, we collected data from 840 fire and police departments. Findings indicate that few departments used these online channels in their Sandy response efforts, and that communications differed between fire and police departments and across media type. However, among the highly engaged departments, there is evidence that they bend and adapt policies about what constitutes appropriate public communication in the face of emergency demands; therefore, we propose that flexibility is important in considering future emergency online communication policy. We conclude with design recommendations for making online communication media more \"listenable\" for both emergency managers and members of the public.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ZAybW7zRxyM?rel=0","title":"Online public communications by police & fire services during the 2012 Hurricane Sandy","filename":"CHI14/p1505","authors":["Amanda L.
