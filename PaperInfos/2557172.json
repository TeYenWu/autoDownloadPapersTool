This technique mechanically focuses the force from a surface onto adjacent discrete forcels (force sensing cells) by way of protrusions (small bumps or pegs), allowing for high-accuracy interpolation between adjacent discrete forcels. MFR works with any force transducing technique or material, including force variable resistive inks, piezoelectric materials and capacitive force plates. MFR sensors can be tiled such that the signal is continuous across contiguous tiles. By minimizing active materials and computational complexity, MFR makes large-format interactive walls, collaborative tabletops and high-resolution floor tiles possible and economically feasible.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Ci7To3t5BjY?rel=0","title":"Mechanical force redistribution: enabling seamless, large-format, high-accuracy surface interaction","filename":"CHI14/p4137","authors":["Alex M.
