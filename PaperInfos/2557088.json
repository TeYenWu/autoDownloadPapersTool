TilTouch gestures extend the vocabulary of navigation interfaces by combining motion tilt with directional touch. We consider sixteen directional TilTouch gestures that rely on tilt and touch movements along the four main compass directions. An experiment explores their effectiveness for both one-handed and two-handed use. Results identify the best combinations of TilTouch gestures in terms of performance, motor coordination, and user preferences.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/GyPfi734ZpE?rel=0","title":"Coordination of tilt and touch in one- and two-handed use","filename":"CHI14/p2001","authors":["Theophanis Tsandilas","Caroline Appert","Anastasia Bezerianos","David Bonnet"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
