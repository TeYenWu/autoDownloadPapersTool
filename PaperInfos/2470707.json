Much like a medical treatment applied to a person based on his specific genetic profile, we argue that theory-driven, personality-targeted UI design can be more effective than design applied to the entire population. The empirical exploration focused on two settings, two populations and two personality traits: Study 1 shows that users' extraversion level moderates the relationship between the UI cue of audience size and users' contribution. Study 2 demonstrates that the effectiveness of social anchors in encouraging online contributions depends on users' level of emotional stability. Taken together, the findings demonstrate the potential and robustness of the interactionist approach to UI design. The findings contribute to the HCI community, and in particular to designers of social systems, by providing guidelines to targeted design that can increase online participation.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/1ghpTkqLaaA?rel=0","title":"Exploring personality-targeted UI design in online social participation systems","filename":"CHI13/p361","authors":["Oded Nov","Ofer Arazy","Claudia López","Peter Brusilovsky"],"conference":"CHI '13","reference":[{"content":"Adaval, R. and Wyer Jr, R.
