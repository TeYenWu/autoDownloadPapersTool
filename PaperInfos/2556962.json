Promoting positive attitudes towards persons with disabilities is an integral step in removing these barriers and improving their quality of life. In this context, persuasive games offer an opportunity of encouraging attitude change. We created a wheelchair-controlled persuasive game to study how embodied interaction can be applied to influence player attitudes over time. Our results show that the game intervention successfully raised awareness for challenges that people using wheelchairs face, and that embodied interaction is a more effective approach than traditional input in terms of retaining attitude change over time. Based on these findings, we provide design strategies for embodied interaction in persuasive games, and outline how our findings can be leveraged to help designers create effective persuasive experiences beyond games.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/A7KzORuuqC8?rel=0","title":"The effects of embodied persuasive games on player attitudes toward people using wheelchairs","filename":"CHI14/p3413","authors":["Kathrin Maria Gerling","Regan L.
