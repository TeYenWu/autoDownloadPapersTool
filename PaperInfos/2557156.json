Instead of following a rigid timetable, London's bus drivers are now required to maintain an equal distance between the bus in front and the one behind. Our qualitative study employs ethnographic fieldwork and in-depth semi-structured interviews to elicit drivers' perspectives of the new system and show how it has modified their driving and general work conditions. We explore how passengers influence the movement of the bus and how the technology frames bus drivers' relationships to their managers and commuters. This work contributes to our understanding of the impact of LBS in the workplace and shows how technological imperatives can be established that cause unanticipated consequences and gradually undermine human relationships.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/PrQ4SN1LuQ8?rel=0","title":"Digitally driven: how location based services impact the work practices of London bus drivers","filename":"CHI14/p3617","authors":["Gary Pritchard","John Vines","Pam Briggs","Lisa Thomas","Patrick Olivier"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
