Although there are many currently used techniques for designing with children, researchers working in differing contexts and in a changing technological landscape find themselves facing difficult design situations. The FACIT PD framework presented in this paper can aid in choosing existing design techniques or in developing new techniques regardless of the stage in the design cycle, the technology being developed, or philosophical approach to design method. The framework consists of eight dimensions, concerning the design partners, the design goal, and the design technique. The partner dimensions are partner experience and need for accommodation. The design goal dimensions are design space and maturity of design. The technique dimensions include: cost, portability, technology and physical interaction. Three cases will be presented which describe new techniques developed using the framework and two cases will describe existing techniques.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/taf2R7xOvHI?rel=0","title":"FACIT PD: a framework for analysis and creation of intergenerational techniques for participatory design","filename":"CHI13/p2893","authors":["Greg Walsh","Elizabeth Foss","Jason Yip","Allison Druin"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
