We draw on our ongoing collaboration with members of feminist hackerspaces in Northern California where we conducted fieldwork over eighteen months in 2014 and 2015. Together we created and distributed a zine -- a self-published magazine produced with a photocopier -- that knit together content of a published paper with local histories of feminist print production. By tracing the efforts involved in this collaboration and its effects on our research project, our research community, and ourselves, we extend HCI's efforts to foster continued dialogue with our sites of study. We end by outlining strategies for bolstering this mission both within and beyond HCI.","title":"Continuing the Dialogue: Bringing Research Accounts Back into the Field","filename":"CHI16/p1426","authors":["Sarah Fox","Daniela K.
