{"paperId":2702208,"citation":[],"abstract":"We explore the everyday use of a new abstraction for mo-bile location-sharing. By sharing the travel time between contacts calculated for walking, transit, and driving, we have enabled users to more easily coordinate meeting up and planning family obligations. Specifically, our participants reported that the information helped to lower the stress of these activities and provided reassurance of the arrival times of their close friends and family. In this paper, we describe our system, motivate its design, and explore results from a 20-user, 21-day field trial showing the use-fulness of the abstraction as well as attitudes towards privacy when sharing travel times with close friends or family.","reference":[{"content":"Agathe Battestini , Vidya Setlur , Timothy Sohn, A large scale study of text-messaging use, Proceedings of the 12th international conference on Human computer interaction with mobile devices and services, September 07-10, 2010, Lisbon, Portugal","paperID":"1851638"},{"content":"Louise Barkhuus , Barry Brown , Marek Bell , Scott Sherwood , Malcolm Hall , Matthew Chalmers, From awareness to repartee: sharing location within social groups, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 05-10, 2008, Florence, Italy","paperID":"1357134"},{"content":"Frank R.
