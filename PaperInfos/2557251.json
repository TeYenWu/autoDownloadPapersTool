Accelerometers have been used in movement recognition systems, but rarely to assess expressive qualities of movement. We present a prototype of wearable system for the real-time detection and classification of movement quality using acceleration data. The system applies Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) to recognize Laban Effort qualities from acceleration input using a Machine Learning software that generates classifications in real time. Existing LMA-recognition systems rely on motion capture data and video data, and can only be deployed in controlled settings. Our single-accelerometer system is portable and can be used under a wide range of environmental conditions. We evaluate the performance of the system, present two applications using the system in the digital arts and discuss future directions.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/m3QTvfI_g8U?rel=0","title":"Designing for movement: evaluating computational models using LMA effort qualities","filename":"CHI14/p991","authors":["Diego Silang Maranan","Sarah Fdili Alaoui","Thecla Schiphorst","Philippe Pasquier","Pattarawut Subyen","Lyn Bartram"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
