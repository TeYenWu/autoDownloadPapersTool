Using a mobile eye tracker during a realistic shopping task in a shopping center, we show that people look at displays more than would be predicted from these observational studies, but still only short glances and often from quite far away. We characterize the patterns of eye-movements that precede looking at a display and discuss some of the design implications for the design of situated display technologies that are deployed in public space.","title":"Display Blindness?: Looking Again at the Visibility of Situated Displays using Eye-tracking","filename":"CHI15/p3889","authors":["Nicholas S.
