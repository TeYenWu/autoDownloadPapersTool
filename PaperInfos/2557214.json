While users often turn to search engines to learn about serious or highly stigmatic conditions, a surprising amount of sensitive health information is also sought and shared via social media, in our case the public social plat-form Twitter. We contrast what health content people seek via search engines vs. share on social media, as well as why they choose a particular platform for online health activi-ties. We reflect on the implications of our results for design-ing search engines, social media, and social search tools that better support people's health information seeking and sharing needs.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xhEjf_Y98S8?rel=0","title":"Seeking and sharing health information online: comparing search engines and social media","filename":"CHI14/p1365","authors":["Munmun De Choudhury","Meredith Ringel Morris","Ryen W.
