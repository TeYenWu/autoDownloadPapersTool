It leverages a physical artifact dedicated to representing remote family members to make it easier to share activities with them. HomeProxy combines a form factor designed for the home environment with a \"no-touch\" user experience and an interface that responsively transitions between recorded and live video messages. We designed and implemented a prototype and conducted a pilot study with eight pairs of users. Our study demonstrated the challenges of a no-touch interface and the promise of offering quick video messaging in the home.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/mEaUa1sdYZM?rel=0","citation":[{"content":"Margot Brereton , Alessandro Soro , Kate Vaisutis , Paul Roe, The Messaging Kettle: Prototyping Connection over a Distance between Adult Children and Older Parents, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 18-23, 2015, Seoul, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2702462"},{"content":"Jeannette Durick , Toni Robertson , Margot Brereton , Frank Vetere , Bjorn Nansen, Dispelling ageing myths in technology design, Proceedings of the 25th Australian Computer-Human Interaction Conference: Augmentation, Application, Innovation, Collaboration, November 25-29, 2013, Adelaide, Australia","paperID":"2541040"},{"content":"Irene Rae , Gina Venolia , John C.
