We developed a new selection technique for multi-touch tablets, called FastTap, that uses thumb-and-finger touches to show and choose from a spatially-stable grid-based overlay interface. FastTap allows novices to view and inspect the full interface, but once item locations are known, FastTap allows people to select commands with a single quick thumb-and-finger tap. The interface helps users develop expertise, since the motor actions carried out as a novice rehearse the expert behavior. A controlled study showed that FastTap was significantly faster (by 33% per selection overall) than marking menus, both for novices and experts, and without reduction in accuracy or subjective preference. Our work introduces a new and efficient selection mechanism that supports rapid command execution on touch tablets, for both novices and experts.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/b4Wrlj2vBZc?rel=0","title":"Faster command selection on tablets with FastTap","filename":"CHI14/p2617","authors":["Carl Gutwin","Andy Cockburn","Joey Scarr","Sylvain Malacria","Scott C.
