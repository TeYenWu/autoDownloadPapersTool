Patina requires no instrumentation of the target application, all data is collected through standard window metrics and accessibility APIs. The primary visualization is a dynamic heatmap overlay which adapts to match the content, location, and shape of the user interface controls visible in the active application. We discuss a set of design guidelines for the Patina system, describe our implementation of the system, and report on an initial evaluation based on a short-term deployment of the system.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/PuMw0CR_FYI?rel=0","title":"Patina: dynamic heatmaps for visualizing application usage","filename":"CHI13/p3227","authors":["Justin Matejka","Tovi Grossman","George Fitzmaurice"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
