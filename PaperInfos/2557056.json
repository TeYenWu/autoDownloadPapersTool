However, touchscreens typically lack the means to distinguish between legitimate stylus and finger touches and touches with the palm or other parts of the hand. This forces users to rest their palms elsewhere or hover above the screen, resulting in ergonomic and usability problems. We present a probabilistic touch filtering approach that uses the temporal evolution of touch contacts to reject palms. Our system improves upon previous approaches, reducing accidental palm inputs to 0.016 per pen stroke, while correctly passing 98% of stylus inputs.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4CgxtuI2Dbw?rel=0","title":"Probabilistic palm rejection using spatiotemporal touch features and iterative classification","filename":"CHI14/p2009","authors":["Julia Schwarz","Robert Xiao","Jennifer Mankoff","Scott E.
