The CS2 meeting is a co-located event with HiPEAC 2014 in Vienna, Austria, January 20, 2014.The wide diffusion of embedded systems, including multi-core, many-core, and re-configurable platforms, poses a number of challenges related to the security of operations of such systems, as well as of the information stored in them. Malicious adversaries can leverage unprotected communications to hijack cyber-physical systems, resulting in incorrect and potentially highly dangerous behaviors, or can exploit side-channel information leakage, as well as reverse engineering hints, to recover secret information from a computing system. Untrustworthy third party software and hardware can create openings for such attacks, which must be detected and removed or counteracted. In addition, the complexity of modern and future embedded and mobile systems leads to the need to depart from manual planning and deployment of security features. Thus, design automation tools are needed to design and verify the security features of new hardware/software systems.The workshop provides a venue for security and cryptography experts to interact with the computer architecture and compilers community, aiming at cross-fertilization and multi-disciplinary approaches to address the security and privacy challenges of computing systems.","title":"Proceedings of the First Workshop on Cryptography and Security in Computing Systems","filename":"CS2undefined/2556315","authors":["Jens Knoop","Valentina Salapura","Israel Koren","Gerardo Pelosi"],"conference":"CS2"}
