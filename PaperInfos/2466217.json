An improved version of Temporal Themes [23] - a vocabulary describing how software can \"use\" time or sequences of events - will be presented, alongside a series of design cases. These exemplify how adding or changing temporal themes in existing applications can enhance functionality and/or interaction. Moreover, the cases also serve as a basis for a discussion of the issues coupled to temporality, control and interaction strategies. Finally, a design approach with focus on temporal aspects is outlined. As a result, the paper opens up for a more conscious use of time and temporality in interaction design.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/-j0WRSpibyo?rel=0","title":"Toying with time: considering temporal themes in interactive artifacts","filename":"CHI13/p1639","authors":["Sus Lundgren"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
