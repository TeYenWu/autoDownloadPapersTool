Prior studies on peer feedback in online communities have suggested its impact on contribution, but have been limited by their correlational nature. In this paper, we conducted a field experiment on Wikipedia to test the effects of different feedback types (positive feedback, negative feedback, directive feedback, and social feedback) on members' contribution. Our results characterize the effects of different feedback types, and suggest trade-offs in the effects of feedback between the focal task and general motivation, as well as differences in how newcomers and experienced editors respond to peer feedback. This research provides insights into the mechanisms underlying peer feedback in online communities and practical guidance to design more effective peer feedback systems.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/wvan9AqFkLI?rel=0","citation":[{"content":"Yurong He , Jennifer Preece , Carol Boston , Anne Bowser , Derek Hansen , Jen Hammock, The effects of individualized feedback on college students' contributions to citizen science, Proceedings of the companion publication of the 17th ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work & social computing, February 15-19, 2014, Baltimore, Maryland, USA","paperID":"2556484"},{"content":"Jennifer Marlow , Laura A.
