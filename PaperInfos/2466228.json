Yet, the basic shape cannot be considered in isolation when interpreting the behavior of passers-by around such displays. In this paper we investigate two further display factors, framedness and seamlessness, that have to be considered in conjunction with the form factor to understand user behavior in front of large non-flat displays. We present the findings from a field study with an interactive column display and take a closer look at how these factors influence actor and bystander behavior. Our results show that rectangular frames act as a sort of funnel for user position and can easily override effects of the non-flat shape on user position and interaction, even though the users didn't recall the presence of these frames.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/VjhEMOoK0JI?rel=0","title":"Squaring the circle: how framing influences user behavior around a seamless cylindrical display","filename":"CHI13/p1729","authors":["Gilbert Beyer","Florian Köttner","Manuel Schiewe","Ivo Haulsen","Andreas Butz"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
