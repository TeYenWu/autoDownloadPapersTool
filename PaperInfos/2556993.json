AudioCanvas allows cameraphone users to interact directly with their own photos of printed media to receive audio feedback or narration. The use of a remote telephone-based service also allows our design to be used over a standard phone line, removing the need for data connections, which can be problematic in developing regions. We show the value of the technique via user evaluations in both a rural Indian village and a South African township.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/YcxDh3yLuEo?rel=0","title":"AudioCanvas: internet-free interactive audio photos","filename":"CHI14/p3735","authors":["Simon Robinson","Jennifer S.
