Yet the relationship between using social media at work and employee performance is not clear. Through a study of 75,747 employees of a large global company over the course of 3 years, we find that some social media usage (number of forum posts, forum post length, and status update length) was positively associated with performance ratings. This study is one of the first to show the relationship among different forms of social media use and employee performance ratings.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/2UDRdCA7t_Y?rel=0","title":"Social media participation and performance at work: a longitudinal study","filename":"CHI14/p115","authors":["N.
