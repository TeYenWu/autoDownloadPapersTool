However traditional news organisations are currently struggling to incorporate this new form of journalism into their existing organisational workflow. We present an analysis from 10 interviews with professional journalists and explore the current issues faced by professional journalists when searching for reliable and reputable local news sources as well as the perceived role of citizen journalists within a large news organisation. From this analysis we present a set of design implications for building systems that support interaction between citizen and professional journalists in order to encourage participatory news production and diversify national news perspectives.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/QO5pgkDsPcI?rel=0","title":"Finding \"real people\": trust and diversity in the interface between professional and citizen journalists","filename":"CHI14/p3015","authors":["Andrew Thomas Garbett","Rob Comber","Paul Egglestone","Maxine Glancy","Patrick Olivier"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
