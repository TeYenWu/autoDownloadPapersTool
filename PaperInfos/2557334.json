Early detection of color blindness among children is useful for parents and teachers to better understand children's needs, to overcome difficulties in learning, and for life and career planning. Unfortunately, current color screening tests are not designed for young children; most require more advanced verbal or cognitive skills. DoDo game has taken a new approach by embedding game elements into a color vision screening test. A user study conducted at Singapore National Eye Centre on twenty-eight children, identified fourteen as Red-Green deficient subjects as did by Ishihara screening test, showed that DoDo was adequately effective in identifying Red-Green color vision deficiency and comparable to two current gold standard colorblind tests, Ishihara and D15.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/T2BUMrS10yQ?rel=0","title":"DoDo game, a color vision deficiency screening test for young children","filename":"CHI14/p2289","authors":["Linh Chi Nguyen","Ellen Yi-Luen Do","Audrey Chia","Yuan Wang","Henry Been-Lirn Duh"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
