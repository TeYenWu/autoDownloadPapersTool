We propose a charging technique for polar aerosols (e.g., mist or fog) that allows control of the shape and trajectory of such non-solid diffusers using electric fields. We report experiments that allowed us to design a charging mechanism that produces charged fog aerosols with homogeneous electrical mobility. We illustrate our idea by demonstrating how electric fields can be used to control the shape of a fog display and the trajectory of a bubble display.","title":"Control of Non-Solid Diffusers by Electrostatic Charging","filename":"CHI15/p11","authors":["Deepak Ranjan Sahoo","Diego Martinez Plasencia","Sriram Subramanian"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
