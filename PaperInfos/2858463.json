To this end, we review commonly used gamification elements in terms of their suitability for such an approach and present the results of an online questionnaire (N=75) complemented by semi-structured interviews with employees of a manufacturing company (N=8). In a twelve-day-long study (N=20) we investigated the usefulness of a task managing app implementing a \"bottom-up\" gamification concept. With these studies, we derived requirements \"bottom-up\" applications should fulfill. The study results reveal that people want to use such an approach and are open to the creation of their own gamified experience, thus suggesting that \"bottom-up\" can be an alternative to \"top-down\" gamification often used today.","title":"\"Don't Whip Me With Your Games\": Investigating \"Bottom-Up\" Gamification","filename":"CHI16/p2026","authors":["Pascal Lessel","Maximilian Altmeyer","Marc Müller","Christian Wolff","Antonio Krüger"],"conference":"CHI '16"}
