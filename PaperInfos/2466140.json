However, self-logging often is difficult to sustain at regular intervals over many weeks. We demonstrate the power of passive mobile notifications to increase logging of wellbeing data, particularly food intake, in a mobile health service. Adding notifications increased the frequency of logging from 12% in a one-month, ten-user pilot study without reminders to 63% in the full 60-user study with reminders included. We will discuss the benefits of passive notifications over existing interruptive methods.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/8xS5-qVH09Y?rel=0","title":"The power of mobile notifications to increase wellbeing logging behavior","filename":"CHI13/p1095","authors":["Frank Bentley","Konrad Tollmar"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
