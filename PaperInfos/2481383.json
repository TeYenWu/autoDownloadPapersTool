The layout of KALQ was determined through first studying how users should grip a device with two hands. We then assigned letters to keys computationally, using a model of two-thumb tapping. KALQ minimizes thumb travel distance and maximizes alternation between thumbs. An error correction algorithm was added to help address linguistic and motor errors. Users reached a rate of 37 words per minute (with a 5% error rate) after a training program.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/HCcLO1AfGAg?rel=0","title":"Improving two-thumb text entry on touchscreen devices","filename":"CHI13/p2765","authors":["Antti Oulasvirta","Anna Reichel","Wenbin Li","Yan Zhang","Myroslav Bachynskyi","Keith Vertanen","Per Ola Kristensson"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
