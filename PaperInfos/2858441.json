We study how to introduce parametric design tools to craftspersons. Our hypothesis is that the arrangement of parametric design in modular representation, in the form of a catalog, can assist makers unfamiliar with this practice. We evaluate this assumption in the realm of bag design, through a Honeycomb Smocking Pattern Catalog and custom Computer-Aided Smocking (CAS) design software. We describe the technical work and designs made with our tools, present a user study that validates our assumptions, and conclude with ideas for future work developing additional tools to bridge computational design and craft.","title":"The Hybrid Bricolage: Bridging Parametric Design with Craft through Algorithmic Modularity","filename":"CHI16/p5984","authors":["Tamara Anna Efrat","Moran Mizrahi","Amit Zoran"],"conference":"CHI '16"}
