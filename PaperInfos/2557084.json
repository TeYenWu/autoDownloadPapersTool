The first two iterations, the Ambient Plant and Presence Clock, were designed for higher socio-economic status (SES) older adults, whereas the Check-In Tree was designed for low SES older adults. We describe how feedback from older adult participants drove our design decisions, and give an in-depth account of how the Check-In Tree evolved from concept to a final design ready for in situ deployment.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/q5ERUOf8DsU?rel=0","title":"From checking on to checking in: designing for low socio-economic status older adults","filename":"CHI14/p1933","authors":["Ingrid Arreola","Zan Morris","Matthew Francisco","Kay Connelly","Kelly Caine","Ginger White"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
