We aim to enable spatial interaction with small, body-worn devices where rich 3D input is desired but the usage of conventional depth sensors is prohibitive due to their power consumption and size. We propose a hybrid classification-regression approach to learn and predict a mapping of RGB colors to absolute, metric depth in real time. We also classify distinct hand gestures, allowing for a variety of 3D interactions. We demonstrate our technique with three mobile interaction scenarios and evaluate the method quantitatively and qualitatively.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/JuwGLnCHvag?rel=0","title":"Joint Estimation of 3D Hand Position and Gestures from Monocular Video for Mobile Interaction","filename":"CHI15/p3657","authors":["Jie Song","Fabrizio Pece","Gábor Sörös","Marion Koelle","Otmar Hilliges"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
