{"paperId":2702401,"abstract":"Physiotherapy patients exercising at home alone are at risk of re-injury since they do not have corrective guidance from a therapist. To explore solutions to this problem, we designed Physio@Home, a prototype that guides people through prerecorded physiotherapy exercises using real-time visual guides and multi-camera views. Our design addresses several aspects of corrective guidance, including: plane and range of movement, joint positions and angles, and extent of movement. We evaluated our design, com-paring how closely people could follow exercise movements under various feedback conditions. Participants were most accurate when using our visual guide and multi-views. We provide suggestions for exercise guidance systems drawn from qualitative findings on visual feedback complexity.","citation":[{"content":"Ping-Hsuan Han , Kuan-Wen Chen , Chen-Hsin Hsieh , Yu-Jie Huang , Yi-Ping Hung, AR-Arm: Augmented Visualization for Guiding Arm Movement in the First-Person Perspective, Proceedings of the 7th Augmented Human International Conference 2016, p.1-4, February 25-27, 2016, Geneva, Switzerland","paperID":"2875237"},{"content":"Maurício Sousa , João Vieira , Daniel Medeiros , Artur Arsenio , Joaquim Jorge, SleeveAR: Augmented Reality for Rehabilitation using Realtime Feedback, Proceedings of the 21st International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, March 07-10, 2016, Sonoma, California, USA","paperID":"2856773"}],"reference":[{"content":"Gazihan Alankus , Amanda Lazar , Matt May , Caitlin Kelleher, Towards customizable games for stroke rehabilitation, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 10-15, 2010, Atlanta, Georgia, USA","paperID":"1753649"},{"content":"Swamy Ananthanarayan , Miranda Sheh , Alice Chien , Halley Profita , Katie Siek, Pt Viz: towards a wearable device for visualizing knee rehabilitation exercises, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 27-May 02, 2013, Paris, France","paperID":"2466161"},{"content":"Fraser Anderson , Tovi Grossman , Justin Matejka , George Fitzmaurice, YouMove: enhancing movement training with an augmented reality mirror, Proceedings of the 26th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology, October 08-11, 2013, St. Andrews, Scotland, United Kingdom","paperID":"2502045"},{"content":"Mobolaji Ayoade , Lynne Baillie, A novel knee rehabilitation system for the home, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 26-May 01, 2014, Toronto, Ontario, Canada","paperID":"2557353"},{"content":"Olivier Bau , Wendy E.
