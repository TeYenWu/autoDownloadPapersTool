This paper presents W3Touch - an interface instrumentation toolkit for web designers to collect user performance data for different device characteristics in order to help them identify potential design problems for touch interaction. Web designers can visualise the data aggregated by W3Touch and use simple metrics to automate the adaptation process for many different viewing and interaction contexts. In a series of experiments with web designers and users, we show that W3Touch is able to detect interaction problems that are hard to find using conventional methods and demonstrate how the tool was successfully used to automate the desktop-to-mobile migration of Wikipedia as an example.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/G0lj_ArvpUg?rel=0","title":"W3touch: metrics-based web page adaptation for touch","filename":"CHI13/p2311","authors":["Michael Nebeling","Maximilian Speicher","Moira Norrie"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
