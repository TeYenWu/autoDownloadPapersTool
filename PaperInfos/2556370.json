{"paperId":2556370,"abstract":"This book provides a single-source reference to routing algorithms for Networks-on-Chip (NoCs), as well as in-depth discussions of advanced solutions applied to current and next generation, many core NoC-based Systems-on-Chip (SoCs). After a basic introduction to the NoC design paradigm and architectures, routing algorithms for NoC architectures are presented and discussed at all abstraction levels, from the algorithmic level to actual implementation. Coverage emphasizes the role played by the routing algorithm and is organized around key problems affecting current and next generation, many-core SoCs. A selection of routing algorithms is included, specifically designed to address key issues faced by designers in the ultra-deep sub-micron (UDSM) era, including performance improvement, power, energy, and thermal issues, fault tolerance and reliability.","reference":[],"citation":[{"content":"Masoumeh Ebrahimi , Masoud Daneshtalab, A Light-weight fault-tolerant routing algorithm tolerating faulty links and routers, Computing, v.97 n.6, p.631-648, June      2015","paperID":"2783210"},{"content":"Masoud Daneshtalab , Masoumeh Ebrahimi , Sergei Dytckov , Juha Plosila, In-order delivery approach for 2D and 3D NoCs, The Journal of Supercomputing, v.71 n.8, p.2877-2899, August    2015","paperID":"2812713"},{"content":"Awet Yemane WeldeZion , Masoumeh Ebrahimi , Masoud Daneshtalab , Hannu Tenhunen, Automated Power and Latency Management in Heterogeneous 3D NoCs, Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Network on Chip Architectures, p.33-38, December 05-05, 2015, Waikiki, HI, USA","paperID":"2835517"},{"content":"Niyati Gupta , Manoj Kumar , Ashish Sharma , Manoj Singh Gaur , Vijay Laxmi , Masoud Daneshtalab , Masoumeh Ebrahimi, Improved Route Selection Approaches using Q-learning framework for 2D NoCs, Proceedings of the 3rd International Workshop on Many-core Embedded Systems, p.33-40, June 13-14, 2015, Portland, OR, USA","paperID":"2768180"},{"content":"A.
