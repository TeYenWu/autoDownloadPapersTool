We propose a classification scheme for bend gestures, and explore how users perform these bend gestures along four classification criterion: location, direction, size, and angle. We collected 36 unique bend gestures performed three times by each participant. The results suggest a strong agreement among participants for preferences of location and direction. Size and angle were difficult for users to differentiate. Finally, users performed and perceived two distinct levels of magnitude. We propose recommendations for designing bend gestures with flexible displays.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/4Wft232b6lA?rel=0","title":"Bending the rules: bend gesture classification for flexible displays","filename":"CHI13/p607","authors":["Kristen Warren","Jessica Lo","Vaibhav Vadgama","Audrey Girouard"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
