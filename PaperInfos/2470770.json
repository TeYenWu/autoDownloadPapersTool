Based on moral balancing and consistency effects, we designed an online experiment to test if signing or not signing an online petition increased or decreased subsequent contribution to a charity. We found that participants who signed the online petition were significantly more likely to donate money to a related charity, demonstrating a consistency effect. We also found that participants who did not sign the petition donated significantly more money to an unrelated charity, demonstrating a moral balancing effect. The results suggest that exposure to an online activism influences individual decision on subsequent civic actions.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/f61NYdYHO-8?rel=0","title":"Does slacktivism hurt activism?: the effects of moral balancing and consistency in online activism","filename":"CHI13/p811","authors":["Yu-Hao Lee","Gary Hsieh"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
