However, there are some unsolved questions regarding the optimal conditions under which this technique functions best. Does it matter in which direction the movement is oriented? Does parallel or sequential performance of the two operations work best? This study attempts to answer this question using a typical Fitts' Law setup but with varying translation-rotation orientation combinations. The results show that right-oriented movements were faster and easier than left-oriented ones. Movement combinations which went in different directions (translation right, rotation left, and vice versa) were found more tiresome and resulted in more strategy switches compared to equi-directional combinations. Our findings can inform positioning decisions in interaction design and contribute to theoretical adjustments to Fitts' Law.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/HsJqs_89vxU?rel=0","title":"Orientation matters: efficiency of translation-rotation multitouch tasks","filename":"CHI14/p2013","authors":["Quan Nguyen","Michael Kipp"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
