By means of a study to evaluate interactive dice prototypes, TUIkit's appropriateness for tracing the effect of different physical attributes (e.g. shape, size, weight, material, texture) on the functional and thus overall user experience was investigated. The results show that separating physical and functional experiences first and joining these afterwards, enhanced the evaluation of TUI prototypes. By applying this approach, participants became more aware of how they physically experienced the prototypes, rather than focusing solely on the functional value of the prototypes. This awareness supports earlier studies that suggest that TUIs consist of more than just interaction, and that form and materiality has a strong impact on their user experience. Finally, we suggest some future adjustments of the TUIkit method.","citation":[{"content":"Daniela Petrelli , Alessandro Soranzo , Luigina Ciolfi , John Reidy, Exploring the Aesthetics of Tangible Interaction: Experiments on the Perception of Hybrid Objects, Proceedings of the TEI '16: Tenth International Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction, February 14-17, 2016, Eindhoven, Netherlands","paperID":"2839478"}],"title":"TUIkit: Evaluating Physical and Functional Experiences of Tangible User Interface Prototypes","filename":"CHI15/p1267","authors":["Jorick Vissers","David Geerts"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
