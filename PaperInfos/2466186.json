Applying this technique to ubiquitous user interfaces, it is possible to detect the 3D-position of multiple human hands in different configurations above a surface that is equipped with a small number of sensors. The retrieved object configurations can significantly improve a user's interaction experience or an application's execution context, for example by detecting multi-hand zoom and rotation gestures or recognizing a grasping hand. We emphasize the broad applicability of the proposed method with a study of a multi-hand gesture recognition device.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/bv3StRrgvXk?rel=0","title":"Swiss-cheese extended: an object recognition method for ubiquitous interfaces based on capacitive proximity sensing","filename":"CHI13/p1401","authors":["Tobias Grosse-Puppendahl","Andreas Braun","Felix Kamieth","Arjan Kuijper"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
