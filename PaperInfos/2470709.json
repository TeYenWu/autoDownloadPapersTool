We show how we sensitized ourselves to theory from diverse intellectual disciplines, to develop an analytical lens to better think about co-located interactions. By critiquing current systems and their conceptual foundations, and further interrelating theories particularly in regard to performative aspects of identity and communication, we develop a more nuanced way of thinking about co-located interactions. Drawing on our sensitivities, we show how we generated and are exploring, through the process of design, a set of co-located interactions that are situated within our social ecologies, and contend that our upfront theoretical work enabled us to identify and explore this space in the first place. This highlights the importance of problem framing, especially for projects adopting design methodologies.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/5T-Xr-8kEUg?rel=0","reference":[{"content":"Till Ballendat , Nicolai Marquardt , Saul Greenberg, Proxemic interaction: designing for a proximity and orientation-aware environment, ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces, November 07-10, 2010, Saarbr√ºcken, Germany","paperID":"1936676"},{"content":"boyd, d.
