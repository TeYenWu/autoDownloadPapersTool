Incorporating living media in these designs can create feelings of empathy and caring in users.

The mushrooms' growth is used to communicate how much speech is used during interaction.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/01a_J6VB3SM?rel=0","title":"Rafigh: a living media interface for speech intervention","filename":"CHI14/p1817","authors":["Foad Hamidi","Melanie Baljko"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
