In this paper, however, we argue that the price for this benefit is bad physical ergonomics: prolonged standing, especially in combination with looking down, quickly causes fatigue and repetitive strain. We propose addressing this issue by allowing users to operate touch floors in any pose they like, including sitting and lying. To allow users to transition between poses seamlessly, we present a simple pose-aware view manager that supports users by adjusting the entire view to the new pose. We support the main assumption behind the work with a simple study that shows that several poses are indeed more ergonomic for touch floor interaction than standing. We ground the design of our view manager by analyzing, which screen regions users can see and touch in each of the respective poses.","title":"Ergonomic Interaction for Touch Floors","filename":"CHI15/p3879","authors":["Dominik Schmidt","Johannes Frohnhofen","Sven Knebel","Florian Meinel","Mariya Perchyk","Julian Risch","Jonathan Striebel","Julia Wachtel","Patrick Baudisch"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
