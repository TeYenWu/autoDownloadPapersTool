We studied how users sign-in to web sites using federated IDs, and found that most survey respondents were not aware of the data they expose. However, when presented with the tradeoffs behind each sign-in option, respondents reported a willingness to change how they sign-in to reduce their data exposure or, in fewer cases, to increase it to receive more benefits from the service. Our findings suggest that data exposure is a concern for users, and that there is a need for finding clearer ways for communicating it for each sign-in option.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/nXzJk-KpF4A?rel=0","title":"Taking data exposure into account: how does it affect the choice of sign-in accounts?","filename":"CHI13/p3423","authors":["Shahar Ronen","Oriana Riva","Maritza Johnson","Donald Thompson"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
