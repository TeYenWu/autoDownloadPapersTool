This adds value to UbiComp and personal informatics in terms of user context and new performance data to collect and visualize, and it benefits healthcare as sleep is correlated with many health issues. To assess this opportunity, we collected one month of phone sensor and sleep diary entries from 27 people who have a variety of sleep contexts. We used this data to construct models that detect sleep and wake states, daily sleep quality, and global sleep quality. Our system classifies sleep state with 93.06% accuracy, daily sleep quality with 83.97% accuracy, and overall sleep quality with 81.48% accuracy. Individual models performed better than generally trained models, where the individual models require 3 days of ground truth data and 3 weeks of ground truth data to perform well on detecting sleep and sleep quality, respectively. Finally, the features of noise and movement were useful to infer sleep quality.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/H_y9HxBRElI?rel=0","title":"Toss 'n' turn: smartphone as sleep and sleep quality detector","filename":"CHI14/p477","authors":["Jun-Ki Min","Afsaneh Doryab","Jason Wiese","Shahriyar Amini","John Zimmerman","Jason I.
