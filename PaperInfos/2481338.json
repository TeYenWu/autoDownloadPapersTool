{"paperId":2481338,"abstract":"As kids encounter food advertisements, it is important that they be able to critically evaluate the message's claims, the healthiness of the promoted product and their desire for it. To explore how technology might help kids develop these skills, we created an online forum called TalkBack that encourages children to critically analyze the messaging in food ads and their attitudes towards marketed foods. We evaluated TalkBack with twenty-eight middle school students in a summer camp program. We discuss how participants appeared to project and protect their sense of self through their interaction with TalkBack. We also describe the limited analytic depth of their forum contributions and suggest directions for HCI research that attempts to encourage critical thinking and health promotion in adolescents.","citation":[{"content":"Azusa Kadomura , Cheng-Yuan Li , Koji Tsukada , Hao-Hua Chu , Itiro Siio, Persuasive technology to improve eating behavior using a sensor-embedded fork, Proceedings of the 2014 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing, September 13-17, 2014, Seattle, Washington","paperID":"2632093"},{"content":"Farnaz Irannejad Bisafar , Andrea Grimes Parker, Confidence & Control: Examining Adolescent Preferences for Technologies that Promote Wellness, Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing, February 27-March 02, 2016, San Francisco, California, USA","paperID":"2820028"},{"content":"Rob Comber , Jaz Hee-Jeong Choi , Jettie Hoonhout , Kenton O'hara, Editorial: Designing for human-food interaction: An introduction to the special issue on 'food and interaction design', International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, v.72 n.2, p.181-184, February, 2014","paperID":"2562876"}],"reference":[{"content":"Bergsma, L.J. and Carney, M.E., \"Effectiveness of health-promoting media literacy education: a systematic review,\" Health Education Research 23, 3 (2008), 522--542.","paperID":"None"},{"content":"Marina U.
