These guides, however, provide no information on the amount of content available. Current mobile devices provide rich output capabilities, and indoor location tracking technology can simplify the selection of content in modern audio guides. In this paper, we compare the keypad-based interface to a map-based interface with and without automatic localization. Through a field study in a local museum with 84 participants, we found that the usability of all versions is rated high, with the keypad interface coming out ahead. Nevertheless, visitors favored the overview of the map and thumbnails to find the right exhibit, while numbers were considered helpful indicators in the real world. Those who used the self-localizing guide preferred it over manually adjusting the map.","title":"Maps and Location: Acceptance of Modern Interaction Techniques for Audio Guides","filename":"CHI16/p1067","authors":["Philipp Wacker","Kerstin Kreutz","Florian Heller","Jan Borchers"],"conference":"CHI '16"}
