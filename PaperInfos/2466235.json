However, in their current form, web tutorials are isolated from the applications that they support. In this paper we present FollowUs, a web-tutorial system that integrates a fully-featured application into a web-based tutorial. This novel architecture enables community enhanced tutorials, which continuously improve as more users work with them. FollowUs captures video demonstrations of users as they perform a tutorial. Subsequent users can use the original tutorial, or choose from a library of captured community demonstrations of each tutorial step. We conducted a user study to test the benefits of making multiple demonstrations available to users, and found that users perform significantly better using our system with a library of multiple demonstrations in comparison to its equivalent baseline system with only the original authored content.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/lwAMvYqfrUM?rel=0","title":"Community enhanced tutorials: improving tutorials with multiple demonstrations","filename":"CHI13/p1779","authors":["Benjamin Lafreniere","Tovi Grossman","George Fitzmaurice"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
