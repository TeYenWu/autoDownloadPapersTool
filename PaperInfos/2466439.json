In this paper, we describe a four-week exploratory study of a social network service (SNS) that allows young adults with autism to garner support from their family and friends. We explore the unique benefits and challenges of using SNSs to mediate requests for help or advice. In particular, we examine the extent to which specialized features of an SNS can engage users in communicating with their network members to get advice in varied situations. Our findings indicate that technology-supported communication particularly strengthened the relationship between the individual and extended network members, mitigating concerns about over-reliance on primary caregivers. Our work identifies implications for the design of social networking services tailored to meet the needs of this special needs population.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/Y1koNVCype8?rel=0","title":"Investigating the use of circles in social networks to support independence of individuals with autism","filename":"CHI13/p3207","authors":["Hwajung Hong","Svetlana Yarosh","Jennifer G.
