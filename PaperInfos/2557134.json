In this paper we exploit the properties of the visual perception to allow users to touch stereoscopically displayed objects when the input is constrained to a 2D surface. Therefore, we have extended and generalized recent evaluations on the user's ability to discriminate small induced object shifts while reaching out to touch a virtual object, and we propose a practical interaction technique, the attracting shift technique, suitable for numerous application scenarios where shallow depth interaction is sufficient. In addition, our results indicate that slight object shifts during touch interaction make the virtual scene appear perceptually more stable compared to a static scene. As a consequence, applications have to manipulate the virtual objects to make them appear static for the user.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/uZL249g8kmM?rel=0","title":"Imperceptible depth shifts for touch interaction with stereoscopic objects","filename":"CHI14/p227","authors":["Dimitar Valkov","Alexander Giesler","Klaus H.
