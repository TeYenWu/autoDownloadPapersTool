In our exploratory lab study, we asked 29 participants about their comfort level in allowing a photo owner to share a picture containing both the participant (subject) and the owner. Our results show that the photo subject feels more comfortable in sharing a photo when i) the \"closeness between the subject and the owner (SO closeness)\" is higher, and ii) the \"closeness between the subject and the viewer (SV closeness)\" is higher. In addition, we observed that both SV and SO closeness are important in determining the subject's picture sharing preference level.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/0JKMCX8L5L8?rel=0"}
