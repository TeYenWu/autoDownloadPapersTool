{"paperId":2481313,"abstract":"We report on a qualitative study of the user experience of cloud-based information work. We characterize the information work practices and challenges that exist largely at the different intersections of three constructs - cloud-based services, collaborations, and digital identifiers. We also demonstrate how the misalignment of these three constructs is experienced as a \"losing battle\" that has led to miscommunication among collaborators, the abandonment of cloud-based services, and the irreparable blurring of digital identities.","reference":[{"content":"Anderson, J.
