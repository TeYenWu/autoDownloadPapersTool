Our estimator can enhance current gestural interfaces by leveraging scale as a natural parameter for gesture input, reflective of user perception (i.e., no training required). Gesture scale can simplify gesture set design, improve gesture-to-function mappings, and reduce the need for users to learn and for recognizers to discriminate unnecessary symbols.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/T_8IHW2ZtWs?rel=0","title":"Small, medium, or large?: estimating the user-perceived scale of stroke gestures","filename":"CHI13/p277","authors":["Radu-Daniel Vatavu","Géry Casiez","Laurent Grisoni"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
