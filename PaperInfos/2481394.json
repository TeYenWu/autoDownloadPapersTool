We created a series of narrative fictions with embedded design concepts, and built low-fi prototype artifacts for directed storytelling sessions with twelve participants. We conclude with a discussion of findings regarding the opportunities to more effectively use narrative techniques and immersive storytelling to create valuable experiences between designers and users.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/INFO24SUKDg?rel=0","title":"Design-driven narrative: using stories to prototype and build immersive design worlds","filename":"CHI13/p2843","authors":["Eric Spaulding","Haakon Faste"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
