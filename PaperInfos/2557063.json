This ensures that critical information (e.g. warnings) is continuously visible and can, in principle, be perceived as quickly as possible. We examined this strategy with a physically and visually distracted driver. We ran two consecutive studies in a driving simulator, comparing different warning visualizations in a head-up display (HUD) and a HMD. In an initial study, we found no significant effects of warning type or display technology on the reaction times. In a second study, after modifying our visualization to include a visual reference marker, we found that with only this minor change, reaction times were significantly lower in the HMD when compared to the HUD. Our insights can help others design better head-stabilized notifications.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/cTU1YWUQAMc?rel=0","title":"In-your-face, yet unseen?: improving head-stabilized warnings to reduce reaction time","filename":"CHI14/p3201","authors":["Felix Lauber","Andreas Butz"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
