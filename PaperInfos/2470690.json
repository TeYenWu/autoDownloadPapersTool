However, the complexity for creating multi-touch interactions hinders this potential. In this paper, we present Gesture Studio, a tool for creating multi-touch interaction behaviors by combining the strength of two distinct but complementary approaches: programming by demonstration and declaration. We employ an intuitive video-authoring metaphor for developers to demonstrate touch gestures, compose complicated behaviors, test these behaviors in the tool and export them as source code that can be integrated into the developers' project.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/H28tQkj2cvE?rel=0","title":"Gesture studio: authoring multi-touch interactions through demonstration and declaration","filename":"CHI13/p257","authors":["Hao Lü","Yang Li"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
