To help blind developers overcome this problem, we present StructJumper, an Eclipse plugin that creates a hierarchical tree based on the nesting structure of a Java class. The programmer can use the TreeView to get an overview of the code structure of the class (including all the methods and control flow statements) and can quickly switch between the TreeView and the Text Editor to get an idea of where they are within the nested structure. To evaluate StructJumper, we had seven blind programmers complete three tasks with and without our tool. We found that the users thought they would use StructJumper and there was a trend that they were faster completing the tasks with StructJumper.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/D2yvrMtOqWc?rel=0","title":"StructJumper: A Tool to Help Blind Programmers Navigate and Understand the Structure of Code","filename":"CHI15/p3043","authors":["Catherine M.
