{"paperId":2557255,"abstract":"A variety of systems have been designed to support communication between distance-separated grandparents and grandchildren. Yet there are few studies of the actual conversational routines of these groups as well as the social challenges that might arise as a result of technology usage. To address this gap, we conducted an interview and diary study that explores the conversational practices of distance-separated grandparents and young grandchildren (aged 3-10) from the perspective of the grandparents and parents of the children. Our results describe the focus of grandparent-grandchild conversations and show that grandparent-grandchild communication is not without its challenges: grandparents sometimes feel self-conscious, perceive that parents or children will be annoyed if they ask too many questions, and do not want to interfere too much in their grandchildren's lives. The implication is that designs should attempt to support the conversation routines and needs of grandparents and grandchildren while attempting to mitigate the social challenges.","citation":[{"content":"Reese Muntean , Carman Neustaedter , Kate Hennessy, Synchronous yoga and meditation over distance using video chat, Proceedings of the 41st Graphics Interface Conference, June 03-05, 2015, Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada","paperID":"2788923"},{"content":"Azadeh Forghani , Gina Venolia , Kori Inkpen, Media2gether: Sharing Media during a Call, Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Supporting Group Work, November 09-12, 2014, Sanibel Island, Florida, USA","paperID":"2660417"},{"content":"Roberta M.
