{"paperId":2702475,"abstract":"We describe a multimodal method for the analysis of co-design outcomes in participatory design (PD) with children. The multimodal approach we take allows researchers to treat both verbal (notes, writings) and tangible material out-comes as complementary ways of communicating design ideas. We argue that an integrated approach in which both PD outcomes are compared and contrasted can result in a richer analysis, in which underlying values can be identified more clearly. To illustrate the method, we describe a PD process with primary school children.","citation":[{"content":"Gabriella Dodero , Rosella Gennari , Alessandra Melonio , Santina Torello, \"There Is No Rose Without A Thorn\": An Assessment of a Game Design Experience for Children, Proceedings of the 11th Biannual Conference on Italian SIGCHI Chapter, September 28-30, 2015, Rome, Italy","paperID":"2808436"},{"content":"Maarten Van Mechelen , Bieke Zaman , Ann Laenen , Vero Vanden Abeele, Challenging group dynamics in participatory design with children: lessons from social interdependence theory, Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Interaction Design and Children, p.219-228, June 21-24, 2015, Boston, Massachusetts","paperID":"2771862"}],"reference":[{"content":"Jeffrey Bardzell, Interaction criticism: An introduction to the practice, Interacting with Computers, v.23 n.6, p.604-621, November, 2011","paperID":"2070200"},{"content":"Bjerknes, G.
