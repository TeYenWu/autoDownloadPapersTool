Part of the mandate of the profession of records management is long-term preservation of digital and paper records. At the site of the fieldwork for this study, research participants' tasks primarily consisted of examining individual case files to determine if the files should be kept or destroyed under the relevant rules set by higher-level management according to legal requirements. Close observation of work practices showed that application of records management rules varied depending on the medium of the records, despite the policy that records on varying media are equal in importance. The results of the study suggest that the perceived accessibility and obsolescence of digital objects deserve more attention in the exploration of the place of digital objects in human lives over the long-term.","title":"Medium, Access, and Obsolescence: What Kinds of Objects are Lasting Objects?","filename":"CHI15/p3433","authors":["Jane Gruning","Julia Bullard","Melissa Ocepek"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
