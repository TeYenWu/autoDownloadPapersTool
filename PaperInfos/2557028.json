But is finger-based navigation really the gold standard' In this paper, we present a comprehensive user study with 40 participants, in which we systematically compared the Pinch-Drag-Flick approach with a technique that relies on spatial manipulation, such as lifting a display up/down to zoom. While we solely considered known techniques, we put considerable effort in implementing both input strategies on popular consumer hardware (iPhone, iPad). Our results show that spatial manipulation can significantly outperform traditional Pinch-Drag-Flick. Given the carefully optimized prototypes, we are confident to have found strong arguments that future generations of mobile devices could rely much more on spatial interaction principles.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/8sswFs62aqw?rel=0","title":"Pinch-drag-flick vs. spatial input: rethinking zoom & pan on mobile displays","filename":"CHI14/p1113","authors":["Martin Spindler","Martin Schuessler","Marcel Martsch","Raimund Dachselt"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
