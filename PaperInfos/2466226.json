We envision that such networks are not restricted to display owners and advertisers anymore, but allow also passersby (e.g., customers) to exchange content, similar to traditional public notice areas, such as bulletin boards. In this context it is crucial to understand emerging practices and provide easy and straight forward interaction techniques to be used for creating and exchanging content. In this paper, we present Digifieds, a digital public notice area we built to investigate and compare possible interaction techniques. Based on a lab study we show that using direct touch at the display as well as using the mobile phone as a complementing interaction technology are most suitable. Direct touch at the display closely resembles the interaction known from classic bulletin boards and provides the highest usability. Mobile phones preserve the users' privacy as they exchange (sensitive) data with the display and at the same time allow content to be created on-the-go or to be retrieved.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/m1PWNRud1xg?rel=0","title":"Interaction techniques for creating and exchanging content with public displays","filename":"CHI13/p1709","authors":["Florian Alt","Alireza Sahami Shirazi","Thomas Kubitza","Albrecht Schmidt"],"conference":"CHI '13","reference":[{"content":"Agamanolis, S.
