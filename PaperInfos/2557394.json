Instead of files, skWiki uses the concept of paths as trajectories of persistent state over time. This model has intrinsic support for collaborative editing, including cloning, branching, and merging paths edited by multiple contributors. We demonstrate skWiki's utility using a qualitative, sketching-based user study.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/kNBSvsUVFIU?rel=0","title":"skWiki: a multimedia sketching system for collaborative creativity","filename":"CHI14/p1235","authors":["Zhenpeng Zhao","Sriram Karthik Badam","Senthil Chandrasegaran","Deok Gun Park","Niklas L.E.
