We present three studies that each contribute (1) improvements to how correlation is calculated in path-mimicry techniques necessary for touchless interaction, (2) a validation of its efficiency in comparison to existing techniques, and (3) a demonstration of its intuitiveness and multi-user capacity 'in the wild'. Our studies consequently demonstrate PathSync's potential as an immediately legitimate alternative to existing techniques, with key advantages for public display and multi-user applications.","title":"PathSync: Multi-User Gestural Interaction with Touchless Rhythmic Path Mimicry","filename":"CHI16/p3415","authors":["Marcus Carter","Eduardo Velloso","John Downs","Abigail Sellen","Kenton O'Hara","Frank Vetere"],"conference":"CHI '16"}
