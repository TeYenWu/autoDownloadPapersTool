Our research is concerned with how to extend this to community-wide participation by devising and deploying multiple voting devices and visualisations. We present an in-the-wild study where a number of shopkeepers along a street participated by placing a novel voting device in their shops to collect locals' opinions. Results were displayed outside the shops, on the pavement. This distributed set-up was found to promote public debate on local issues, particularly around the perceived divide between people on either end of the street. We outline our design process and describe the impact of distributing voting devices and situated visualisations in a local community. \\","title":"\"Everyone Is Talking about It!\": A Distributed Approach to Urban Voting Technology and Visualisations","filename":"CHI15/p3127","authors":["Lisa Koeman","Vaiva Kalnikaité","Yvonne Rogers"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
