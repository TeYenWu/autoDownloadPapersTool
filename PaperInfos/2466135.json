{"paperId":2466135,"abstract":"Positive emotional experiences with an interactive product are assumed to lead to good user experience and, ultimately, to product success. However, the path from emotional experiences to product evaluation may not be direct, as emotions fluctuate over time, and some experiences are easier to recall than others. In this study, we examined emotions and experience episodes during real-life mobile phone use over a five-month period. The goal is to understand how emotions and memories are related to overall evaluation of a product: usability, user experience and behavioral intentions. The results show that both emotions and how people remember them had strong unique roles in the overall evaluation of the product. Positive emotions were mostly related to good user experience and negative emotions to low usability. In the early stages of use, users overestimated their positive emotions and seemed to focus on user experience, the importance of usability increased over time.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/3HpVcrDmtF4?rel=0","title":"Emotions, experiences and usability in real-life mobile phone use","filename":"CHI13/p1061","authors":["Sari Kujala","Talya Miron-Shatz"],"conference":"CHI '13","citation":[{"content":"Jari Varsaluoma , Farrukh Sahar, Usefulness of long-term user experience evaluation to product development: practitioners' views from three case studies, Proceedings of the 8th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction: Fun, Fast, Foundational, p.79-88, October 26-30, 2014, Helsinki, Finland","paperID":"2641218"},{"content":"Roland Buchner , Daniela Wurhofer , Astrid Weiss , Manfred Tscheligi, Robots in Time: How User Experience in Human-Robot Interaction Changes over Time, Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Social Robotics, October 27-29, 2013, Bristol, UK","paperID":"2688733"},{"content":"Farrukh Sahar , Jari Varsaluoma , Sari Kujala, Comparing the effectiveness of electronic diary and UX curve methods in multi-component product study, Proceedings of the 18th International Academic MindTrek Conference: Media Business, Management, Content & Services, November 04-06, 2014, Tampere, Finland","paperID":"2676500"},{"content":"Jari Varsaluoma , Farrukh Sahar, Measuring retrospective user experience of non-powered hand tools: an exploratory remote study with UX curve, Proceedings of the 18th International Academic MindTrek Conference: Media Business, Management, Content & Services, November 04-06, 2014, Tampere, Finland","paperID":"2676485"},{"content":"Alexander Meschtscherjakov , David Wilfinger , Manfred Tscheligi, Mobile attachment causes and consequences for emotional bonding with mobile phones, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 26-May 01, 2014, Toronto, Ontario, Canada","paperID":"2557295"},{"content":"Sandra Trösterer , Daniela Wurhofer , Christina Rödel , Manfred Tscheligi, Using a Parking Assist System Over Time: Insights on Acceptance and Experiences, Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Automotive User Interfaces and Interactive Vehicular Applications, September 17-19, 2014, Seattle, WA, USA","paperID":"2667327"},{"content":"Farrukh Sahar , Jari Varsaluoma , Sari Kujala , Kaisa Väänänen-Vainio-Mattila, Identifying the user experience factors of a multi-component sports product, Proceedings of the 18th International Academic MindTrek Conference: Media Business, Management, Content & Services, November 04-06, 2014, Tampere, Finland","paperID":"2676499"},{"content":"Sari Kujala , Talya Miron-Shatz, The evolving role of expectations in long-term user experience, Proceedings of the 19th International Academic Mindtrek Conference, September 22-24, 2015, Tampere, Finland","paperID":"2818271"},{"content":"Eeva Raita , Antti Oulasvirta, Mixed feelings?: the relationship between perceived usability and user experience in the wild, Proceedings of the 8th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer Interaction: Fun, Fast, Foundational, p.1-10, October 26-30, 2014, Helsinki, Finland","paperID":"2639207"},{"content":"Alexandre N.
