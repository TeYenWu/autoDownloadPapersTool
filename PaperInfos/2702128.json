Rather than enhancing objects directly, however, we implement this concept by enhancing the user. We call this affordance++. By stimulating the user's arms using electrical muscle stimulation, our prototype allows objects not only to make the user actuate them, but also perform required movements while merely approaching the object, such as not to touch objects that do not \"want\" to be touched. In our user study, affordance++ helped participants to successfully operate devices of poor natural affordance, such as a multi-functional slicer tool or a magnetic nail sweeper, and to stay away from cups filled with hot liquids.","title":"Affordance++: Allowing Objects to Communicate Dynamic Use","filename":"CHI15/p2515","authors":["Pedro Lopes","Patrik Jonell","Patrick Baudisch"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
