Although users make their own personal guides, they are immersed in a social curatorial experience where they are influenced directly and indirectly by the guides of others. We use a 2-week field trial involving 20 residents of Pittsburgh as a technological probe to explore the initial design decisions, and we further refine the design landscape through subject interviews. Based on this study, we identify a set of design recommendations for building scalable social platforms for curating the experiences of the city.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/sCfhzP_yK04?rel=0","title":"Curated city: capturing individual city guides through social curation","filename":"CHI14/p3249","authors":["Justin B.
