In our analysis, we characterize how these CHI authors conceptualize design practice and the types of contributions they propose. This work is motivated by the recognition that design methods proposed by HCI researchers often do not fit the needs and constraints of professional design practice. As a complement to the analysis of the CHI papers we also interviewed 13 practitioners about their attitudes towards learning new methods and approaches. We conclude the note by offering some critical reflections about how HCI research can better support actual design practice.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/zshA1_8UEoI?rel=0","title":"Design research at CHI and its applicability to design practice","filename":"CHI13/p1951","authors":["David J.
