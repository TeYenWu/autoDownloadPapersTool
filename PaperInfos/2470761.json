Touchbugs are active tangibles that are able to move across surfaces by employing vibrating motors and can communicate with camera based multi-touch surfaces using infrared LEDs. Touchbug's embedded inertial sensors and computational capabilities open a new interaction space by providing autonomous capabilities for tangibles that allow goal directed behavior.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/lCTy9_egkOM?rel=0","title":"Touchbugs: actuated tangibles on multi-touch tables","filename":"CHI13/p759","authors":["Diana Nowacka","Karim Ladha","Nils Y.
