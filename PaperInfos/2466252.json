With embodied interaction experiences, increased localization accuracy supports greater nuance in interaction design, but there is usually a tradeoff between fast, accurate tracking and the ability to preserve the identity of users. Customization of experience relies on the ability to detect the identity of visitors, however. We present a method that combines fine-grained indoor tracking with robust preservation of the unique identities of multiple users. Our model merges input from an RFID reader with input from a commercial camera-based tracking system. We developed a probabilistic Bayesian model to infer at run-time the correct identification of the subjects in the camera's field of view. This method, tested in a lab and at a local museum, requires minimal modification to the exhibition space, while addressing several identity-preservation problems for which many indoor tracking systems do not have robust solutions.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/aOdI0rzw_mo?rel=0","title":"I see you there!: developing identity-preserving embodied interaction for museum exhibits","filename":"CHI13/p1911","authors":["Francesco Cafaro","Alessandro Panella","Leilah Lyons","Jessica Roberts","Josh Radinsky"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
