We show that MultiNet has usability benefits over currently deployed commercial solutions while being backwards compatible with existing devices. MultiNet reduces the interaction overhead of secure association by focusing on users' interactions rather than the network's requirements. This leads to a novel architectural arrangement of the home network infrastructure: the network is dynamically re-configured to accept each pre-configured device, rather than the current norm where each device is configured to be acceptable to the pre-configured network. Assuming devices are pre-configured for a unique, device-specific network name and passphrase, MultiNet constructs an out-of-band visual channel via an intermediary network controller device to convey the device's configuration to the network. This makes the interaction to join a device to the wireless network lightweight and identical across all devices, considerably reducing the interaction overheads for users.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/bNaEllrGAzU?rel=0","title":"MultiNet: reducing interaction overhead in domestic wireless networks","filename":"CHI13/p1569","authors":["Anthony Brown","Richard Mortier","Tom Rodden"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
