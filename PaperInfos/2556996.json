We introduce Twitch, a mobile phone application that asks users to make a micro-contribution each time they unlock their phone. Twitch takes advantage of the common habit of turning to the mobile phone in spare moments. Twitch crowdsourcing activities span goals such as authoring a census of local human activity, rating stock photos, and extracting structured data from Wikipedia pages. We report a field deployment of Twitch where 82 users made 11,240 crowdsourcing contributions as they used their phone in the course of everyday life. The median Twitch activity took just 1.6 seconds, incurring no statistically distinguishable costs to unlock speed or cognitive load compared to a standard slide-to-unlock interface.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/OQnKv8uWIqs?rel=0","title":"Twitch crowdsourcing: crowd contributions in short bursts of time","filename":"CHI14/p3645","authors":["Rajan Vaish","Keith Wyngarden","Jingshu Chen","Brandon Cheung","Michael S.
