This initial gesture can serve as gesture registration for advanced operations. We propose three strategies to reveal the initial gesture: spatial division, temporal division and integration. Spatial division permanently shows the gesture on a dedicated screen area. Temporal division interrupts the application to reveal the gesture. Integration embeds gesture hints directly in the application. We also propose a novel initial gesture called Teapot to illustrate our strategies. We report on a laboratory and field study. Our main findings are: A large percentage of all users execute the gesture, especially with spatial division (56%). Users intuitively discover a gesture vocabulary by exploring variations of the Teapot gesture by themselves, as well as by imitating and extending other users' variations.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/fJZehmHv6ZE?rel=0","title":"StrikeAPose: revealing mid-air gestures on public displays","filename":"CHI13/p841","authors":["Robert Walter","Gilles Bailly","Jörg Müller"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
