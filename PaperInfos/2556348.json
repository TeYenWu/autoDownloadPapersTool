It will be divided into two main parts: resource allocation and transceiver architectures. These two research areas are at the core of the recent advances experimented by wireless communication systems. Each chapter will cover a relevant, timely, topic with two focuses: a first part which is of tutorial and survey nature, reviews the state of the art in that topic, followed by a more deep treatment including current research topics, case studies and performance analysis.","title":"Resource Allocation and MIMO for 4G and Beyond","authors":""}
