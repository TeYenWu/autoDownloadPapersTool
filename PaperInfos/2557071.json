Users can view the map through handheld, spatially aware displays that serve as peepholes and navigate the map by moving these displays in physical space. We conducted a controlled experiment of peephole map navigation with 16 participants to better understand the effect of a peephole's size on users' map navigation behavior, navigation performance, and task load. Simulating different peephole sizes from 4' (smartphone) up to 120' (control condition), we confirmed that larger peepholes significantly improve learning speed, navigation speed, and reduce task load; however, this added benefit diminishes with growing sizes. Our data shows that a relatively small, tablet-sized peephole can serve as a 'sweet spot' between peephole size and both user navigation performance and user task load.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/GHGGLnu3jxM?rel=0","title":"Bigger is not always better: display size, performance, and task load during peephole map navigation","filename":"CHI14/p4127","authors":["Roman Rädle","Hans-Christian Jetter","Jens Müller","Harald Reiterer"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
