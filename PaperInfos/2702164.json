{"paperId":2702164,"abstract":"Most laptops and personal computers have webcams with LED indicators to notify users when they are recording. Because hackers use surreptitiously captured webcam recordings to extort users, we explored the effectiveness of these indicators under varying circumstances and how they could be improved. We observed that, on average, fewer than half of our participants (45%) noticed the existing indicator during computer-based tasks. When seated in front of the computer performing a paper-based task, only 5% noticed the indicator. We performed a followup experiment to evaluate a new indicator and observed that adding onscreen glyphs had a significant impact on both computer-based and non-computer-based tasks (93% and 59% noticed the new indicator, respectively). We discuss how our results can be integrated into current systems, as well as future ubiquitous computing systems.","citation":[{"content":"Barrett Ens , Tovi Grossman , Fraser Anderson , Justin Matejka , George Fitzmaurice, Candid Interaction: Revealing Hidden Mobile and Wearable Computing Activities, Proceedings of the 28th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software & Technology, November 08-11, 2015, Daegu, Kyungpook, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2807449"}],"reference":[{"content":"Gregory D.
