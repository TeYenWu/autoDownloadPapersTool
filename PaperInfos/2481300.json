We have observed, studied, prototyped and discussed with controllers a new mixed interaction system based on Anoto, video projection, and tracking. Starting from the understanding of the benefits of tangible paper strips, our goal is to study how mixed physical and virtual augmented data can support the controllers' mental work. The context of the activity led us to depart from models that are proposed in tangible interfaces research where coherence is based on how physical objects are representative of virtual objects. We propose a new account of coherence in a mixed interaction system that integrates externalization mechanisms. We found that physical objects play two roles: they act both as representation of mental objects and as tangible artifacts for interacting with augmented features. We observed that virtual objects represent physical ones, and not the reverse, and, being virtual representations of physical objects, should seamlessly converge with the cognitive role of the physical object. Finally, we show how coherence is achieved by providing a seamless interactive space.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/xkQci4ms4lg?rel=0","title":"Flights in my hands: coherence concerns in designing Strip'TIC, a tangible space for air traffic controllers","filename":"CHI13/p2175","authors":["Catherine Letondal","Christophe Hurter","Rémi Lesbordes","Jean-Luc Vinot","Stéphane Conversy"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
