We describe an experiment that examined users completing two different tasks with the aid of a remote gesturing device under two conditions: when control of the camera and gesturing point of view was in the hands of the remote helper, and when it was in the hands of the worker. Results indicate that in general, when most of the knowledge is with the helper, it is preferable to leave control in the hands of the helper. However, these results may depend on the situation and task at hand.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/9mSeFb0GHiw?rel=0","title":"Ownership and control of point of view in remote assistance","filename":"CHI13/p2243","authors":["Joel Lanir","Ran Stone","Benjamin Cohen","Pavel Gurevich"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
