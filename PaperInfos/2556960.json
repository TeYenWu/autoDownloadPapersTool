In this paper we introduce Experience Design Theatre (EDT) as an approach to undertaking experience-centered design with multiple parties in the early stages of design. EDT was motivated by a need to involve several diverse groups of people in the design of a digitally coordinated care service - NetCarers. We used live theatre as a way to engage small groups of participants in dialogues around the design of NetCarers, to qualify their contributions in a refined performance, and to communicate their concerns and aspirations to domain experts. We highlight key benefits to using live theatre in experience-centered design and offer insights for researchers undertaking similar work in the future.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/zcNtDjtqNtE?rel=0","title":"Experience design theatre: exploring the role of live theatre in scaffolding design dialogues","filename":"CHI14/p683","authors":["John Vines","Tess Denman-Cleaver","Paul Dunphy","Peter Wright","Patrick Olivier"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
