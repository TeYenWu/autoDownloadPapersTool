WADE clones the Graphical User Interface (GUI) of a host program through dynamic-link library (DLL) injection, enabling modifications to (1) the GUI in a WYSIWYG fashion and (2) software functionality. We compare WADE with an alternative state-of-the-art runtime toolkit overloading approach in a user-study, whose results demonstrate that WADE significantly simplifies the task of GUI-based add-on development.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/1OCFWDBef_M?rel=0","title":"WADE: simplified GUI add-on development for third-party software","filename":"CHI14/p2221","authors":["Xiaojun Meng","Shengdong Zhao","Yongfeng Huang","Zhongyuan Zhang","James Eagan","Ramanathan Subramanian"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
