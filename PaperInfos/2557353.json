We present the rehabilitation visualization system and the results of a randomized controlled study in which we investigated the usability and feasibility of the system in the home. We found that our users were able to use the system successfully for their rehabilitation with improved rehabilitation outcomes after 6 weeks when compared to the current rehabilitation care. Finally we highlight the lessons learned which will benefit prospective designers of home rehabilitation technology in ensuring successful home evaluations in clinical rehabilitation.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/R9WZyoqqEVA?rel=0","title":"A novel knee rehabilitation system for the home","filename":"CHI14/p2521","authors":["Mobolaji Ayoade","Lynne Baillie"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
