The wide input space is leveraged for a horizontal spatial mapping of quickly accessible information and applications. We discuss social implications and interaction capabilities for unobtrusive touch input and present our hardware implementation and a set of applications that benefit from the quick access time. In a qualitative user study with 14 participants we found out that for short interactions (2-4 seconds), most of the surface area is considered as appropriate input space, while for longer interactions (up to 10 seconds), the front areas above the trouser pockets are preferred.","title":"Belt: An Unobtrusive Touch Input Device for Head-worn Displays","filename":"CHI15/p2135","authors":["David Dobbelstein","Philipp Hock","Enrico Rukzio"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
