We position this as a means for communities to represent themselves to designers, both as a method of designing community technologies and as a first step towards supporting innovation at a local level. To demonstrate insight journalism, we present two case studies of community technologies that were directly inspired, informed and evaluated by journalistic content. Based on this experience, we evaluate the role that insight journalism can play in designing for communities, the particular characteristics that it lends to the design process and how it might be employed to support sustainable community innovation.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/0zg5R6sgHWM?rel=0","title":"Utilising insight journalism for community technology design","filename":"CHI14/p2995","authors":["Nick Taylor","David M.
