However, few of the described systems support simulations for collaborative learning, and none of them explicitly address immersion. We present SimMed, a system allowing medical students to collaboratively diagnose and treat a virtual patient using an interactive tabletop. The hybrid user interface combines elements of virtual reality with multitouch input. The paper delineates the development process of the system and rationale behind a range of interface design decisions. Thereby, the role of realism in gaining procedural knowledge is discussed - in particular, the interplay between realism, immersion and training goals. We implemented several medical test cases and evaluated our approach with a user study that suggests the great potential of the system. Results show a high level of immersion, cooperation and engagement by the students.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/u3_DYFPI7so?rel=0","title":"SimMed: combining simulation and interactive tabletops for medical education","filename":"CHI13/p1469","authors":["Ulrich von Zadow","Sandra Buron","Tina Harms","Florian Behringer","Kai Sostmann","Raimund Dachselt"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
