Planning these releases involves deciding which features of the system should be implemented for each release. This is a complex planning process involving numerous trade-offs-constraints and factors that often make decisions difficult. Since the success of a product depends on this plan, it is important to understand the trade-offs between different release plans in order to make an informed choice. We present STRATOS, a tool that simultaneously visualizes several software release plans. The visualization shows several attributes about each plan that are important to planners. Multiple plans are shown in a single layout to help planners find and understand the trade-offs between alternative plans. We evaluated our tool via a qualitative study and found that STRATOS enables a range of decision-making processes, helping participants decide on which plan is most optimal.","title":"STRATOS: Using Visualization to Support Decisions in Strategic Software Release Planning","filename":"CHI15/p1479","authors":["Bon Adriel Aseniero","Tiffany Wun","David Ledo","Guenther Ruhe","Anthony Tang","Sheelagh Carpendale"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
