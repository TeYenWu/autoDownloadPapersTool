{"paperId":2702356,"citation":[],"abstract":"An overwhelming variety of communication channels are available to consumers. Here, we present an overview of the aspects that need to be accounted for when intimate partners select a communication channel. We present interviews with 10 cohabiting couples (20 participants) and an 8-day diary study of communication and coordination. Using reported instances of within-couple communication, triggered by relationship-oriented or practical household needs, we identify why particular channels are chosen or sequenced. Extending media richness critiques, we identify additional factors that influence communication choice such as intimate knowledge of the others' habits, possibilities to add emotional meaning, and couples' shared needs as an identifiable unit. We also extend the notion of network effects on channel choice, and discuss the ecology of channel, networks, devices and device settings involved between partners. Finally, channel choice is not an all-or-nothing game; multiple channels can, and must, co-exist.","reference":[{"content":"Matthias Böhmer , Brent Hecht , Johannes Schöning , Antonio Krüger , Gernot Bauer, Falling asleep with Angry Birds, Facebook and Kindle: a large scale study on mobile application usage, Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Human Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices and Services, August 30-September 02, 2011, Stockholm, Sweden","paperID":"2037383"},{"content":"Karen Church , Rodrigo de Oliveira, What's up with whatsapp?: comparing mobile instant messaging behaviors with traditional SMS, Proceedings of the 15th international conference on Human-computer interaction with mobile devices and services, August 27-30, 2013, Munich, Germany","paperID":"2493225"},{"content":"Alan R.
