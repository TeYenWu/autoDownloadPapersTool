To address this, we present a flexible decoder for touchscreen text entry that combines probabilistic touch models with a language model. We investigate two different touch models. The first touch model is based on a Gaussian Process regression approach and implicitly models the inherent uncertainty of the touching process. The second touch model allows users to explicitly control the uncertainty via touch pressure. Using the first model we show that the character error rate can be reduced by up to 7% over a baseline method, and by up to 1.3% over a leading commercial keyboard. Using the second model we demonstrate that providing users with control over input certainty reduces the amount of text users have to correct manually and increases the text entry rate.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/D1tY31hjIoQ?rel=0","title":"Uncertain text entry on mobile devices","filename":"CHI14/p2307","authors":["Daryl Weir","Henning Pohl","Simon Rogers","Keith Vertanen","Per Ola Kristensson"],"conference":"CHI '14","reference":[{"content":"Xiaojun Bi , Yang Li , Shumin Zhai, FFitts law: modeling finger touch with fitts' law, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 27-May 02, 2013, Paris, France","paperID":"2466180"},{"content":"Xiaojun Bi , Shumin Zhai, Bayesian touch: a statistical criterion of target selection with finger touch, Proceedings of the 26th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology, October 08-11, 2013, St. Andrews, Scotland, United Kingdom","paperID":"2502058"},{"content":"Stephen A.
