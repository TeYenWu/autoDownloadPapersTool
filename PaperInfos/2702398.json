Producing alternatives is a key feature of creative work, yet it is not strongly supported in most extant tools. GEM-NI enables various forms of exploration with alternatives such as parallel editing, recalling history, branching, merging, comparing, and Cartesian products of and for alternatives. Further, GEM-NI provides a modal graphical user interface and a design gallery, which both allow designers to control and manage their design exploration. We conducted an exploratory user study followed by in-depth one-on-one interviews with moderately and highly skills participants and obtained positive feedback for the system features, showing that GEM-NI supports creative design work well.","title":"GEM-NI: A System for Creating and Managing Alternatives In Generative Design","filename":"CHI15/p1201","authors":["Loutfouz Zaman","Wolfgang Stuerzlinger","Christian Neugebauer","Rob Woodbury","Maher Elkhaldi","Naghmi Shireen","Michael Terry"],"conference":"CHI '15"}
