{"paperId":2702353,"abstract":"In this paper, we investigate the potential of controlled in-the-wild studies as an evaluation methodology that merges the benefits of lab-based and in-the-wild studies. Our exploratory investigation builds upon a comparative, between subject experiment benchmarking different interaction features of a custom public installation that visualized a series of urban datasets. In order to evaluate the usefulness of the in-the-wild versus the controlled in-the-wild methodologies, we compared the resulting findings in terms of participant engagement, insight generation, and social interaction. We propose that a controlled in-the-wild study offers a viable alternative when evaluating more complex interaction methods in public space, hereby potentially reducing the practical efforts of in-the-wild studies to involve participants.","reference":[{"content":"Florian Alt , Stefan Schneegaß , Albrecht Schmidt , Jörg Müller , Nemanja Memarovic, How to evaluate public displays, Proceedings of the 2012 International Symposium on Pervasive Displays, p.1-6, June 04-05, 2012, Porto, Portugal","paperID":"2307815"},{"content":"Gilbert Beyer , Florian Alt , Jörg Müller , Albrecht Schmidt , Karsten Isakovic , Stefan Klose , Manuel Schiewe , Ivo Haulsen, Audience behavior around large interactive cylindrical screens, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, May 07-12, 2011, Vancouver, BC, Canada","paperID":"1979095"},{"content":"Eva Hornecker , Emma Nicol, What do lab-based user studies tell us about in-the-wild behavior?: insights from a study of museum interactives, Proceedings of the Designing Interactive Systems Conference, June 11-15, 2012, Newcastle Upon Tyne, United Kingdom","paperID":"2318010"},{"content":"Kjeldskov, J., Skov, M.
