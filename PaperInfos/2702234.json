This paper fills that gap by reviewing and engaging with conceptual and theoretical models of reflection, organized by the disciplinary and epistemological perspectives each embodies. Synthesizing across this theoretical background, the paper identifies three dimensions of reflection: breakdown, inquiry, and transformation. Together, these dimensions serve as the foundation for reflective informatics, a conceptual approach that helps bring clarity and guidance to the discussion of designing for reflection. The paper distinguishes reflective informatics by demonstrating how it both differs from and complements existing related work. Finally, the paper provides a critically reflexive consideration of its own latent assumptions, especially about the value of reflection, and how they might impact work on designing for reflection.","citation":[{"content":"Ine Mols , Elise van den Hoven , Berry Eggen, Technologies for Everyday Life Reflection: Illustrating a Design Space, Proceedings of the TEI '16: Tenth International Conference on Tangible, Embedded, and Embodied Interaction, February 14-17, 2016, Eindhoven, Netherlands","paperID":"2839466"},{"content":"Anja Thieme , Jayne Wallace , Thomas D.
