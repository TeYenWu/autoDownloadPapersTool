We present a series of games that result in valuable physical objects being destroyed objects owned by the players. Interestingly, we found that we can design these games to be desirable to play, despite the loss of the object, by instead producing social value. As part of a user study, twelve students played a destructive game in which a laser cutter cut up their own money bills. Surprisingly, 8 out of 12 participants would play again. They shared their post-game stories with us.","title":"Destructive Games: Creating Value by Destroying Valuable Physical Objects","filename":"CHI16/p3970","authors":["David Eickhoff","Stefanie Mueller","Patrick Baudisch"],"conference":"CHI '16"}
