We compared maintenance performance across four different development environments: an IDE without any call graph exploration tool, a Call Hierarchy tool as found in Eclipse, and the tools Stacksplorer [7]and Blaze [11]. Using any of the call graph exploration tools more developers could solve certain maintenance tasks correctly. Only Stacksplorer and Blaze, however, were also able to decrease task completion times, although the Call Hierarchy offers access to a larger part of the call graph. To investigate if this result was caused by a change in navigation behavior between the tools, we used a set of predictive models to create formally comparable descriptions of programmer navigation. The results suggest that the decrease in task completion times has been caused by Stacksplorer and Blaze promoting call graph navigation more than the Call Hierarchy tool.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/ONwP5NcyhuU?rel=0","citation":[{"content":"Martin Konopka , Pavol Navrat , Maria Bielikova, Discovering code dependencies by harnessing developer's activity, Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Software Engineering, May 16-24, 2015, Florence, Italy","paperID":"2819174"},{"content":"Martin Konopka, Combining eye tracking with navigation paths for identification of cross-language code dependencies, Proceedings of the 2015 10th Joint Meeting on Foundations of Software Engineering, August 30-September 04, 2015, Bergamo, Italy","paperID":"2807561"},{"content":"Vinay Augustine , Patrick Francis , Xiao Qu , David Shepherd , Will Snipes , Christoph Bräunlich , Thomas Fritz, A field study on fostering structural navigation with prodet, Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Software Engineering, May 16-24, 2015, Florence, Italy","paperID":"2819043"}],"title":"How tools in IDEs shape developers' navigation behavior","filename":"CHI13/p3073","authors":["Jan-Peter Krämer","Thorsten Karrer","Joachim Kurz","Moritz Wittenhagen","Jan Borchers"],"conference":"CHI '13"}
