Such keyboards have been used extensively for touch devices, but not in mid-air, even though their fluent gestural input seems well suited for this modality. We present Vulture, a word-gesture keyboard for mid-air operation. Vulture adapts touch based word-gesture algorithms to work in mid-air, projects users' movement onto the display, and uses pinch as a word delimiter. A first 10-session study suggests text-entry rates of 20.6 Words Per Minute (WPM) and finds hand-movement speed to be the primary predictor of WPM. A second study shows that with training on a few phrases, participants do 28.1 WPM, 59% of the text-entry rate of direct touch input. Participants' recall of trained gestures in mid-air was low, suggesting that visual feedback is important but also limits performance. Based on data from the studies, we discuss improvements to Vulture and some alternative designs for mid-air text entry.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/7CKJ6B_dFhc?rel=0","title":"Vulture: a mid-air word-gesture keyboard","filename":"CHI14/p1073","authors":["Anders Markussen","Mikkel Rønne Jakobsen","Kasper Hornbæk"],"conference":"CHI '14","reference":[{"content":"Christoph Amma , Marcus Georgi , Tanja Schultz, Airwriting: Hands-Free Mobile Text Input by Spotting and Continuous Recognition of 3d-Space Handwriting with Inertial Sensors, Proceedings of the 2012 16th Annual International Symposium on Wearable Computers (ISWC), p.52-59, June 18-22, 2012","paperID":"2358017"},{"content":"Amartya Banerjee , Jesse Burstyn , Audrey Girouard , Roel Vertegaal, MultiPoint: Comparing laser and manual pointing as remote input in large display interactions, International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, v.70 n.10, p.690-702, October, 2012","paperID":"2351169"},{"content":"Xiaojun Bi , Ciprian Chelba , Tom Ouyang , Kurt Partridge , Shumin Zhai, Bimanual gesture keyboard, Proceedings of the 25th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology, October 07-10, 2012, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA","paperID":"2380136"},{"content":"Géry Casiez , Nicolas Roussel , Daniel Vogel, 1 € filter: a simple speed-based low-pass filter for noisy input in interactive systems, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, May 05-10, 2012, Austin, Texas, USA","paperID":"2208639"},{"content":"Steven J.
