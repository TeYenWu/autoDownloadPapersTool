Recently, Guimbretière et al. [1] demonstrated that such helper cores can also be used to execute simple user interface tasks. We revisit this approach by implementing a similar system on an off-the-shelf application processor (TI OMAP4). Our study shows that in the case of high event rate interactions (pen inking and virtual keyboard), significant battery life gains (×1.7 and ×2.3 respectively) can be achieved with the helper core executing the interface. Having the helper core only dis-patch input events incurs a 18% penalty relative to the maximum savings rate, but allows for simplified deployment since it merely requires a change in toolkit infrastructure.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/l9TyPR-qTRE?rel=0","title":"Using asymmetric cores to reduce power consumption for interactive devices with bi-stable displays","filename":"CHI14/p1059","authors":["Jaeyeon Kihm","François V.
