{"paperId":2466202,"abstract":"The rising popularity of location-based applications and games (LBAGs) that break spatial, temporal, and social boundaries creates new challenges for designers. This paper introduces PLACE, an iterative, mixed-fidelity approach to Prototyping Location, Activities, Collective experience, and Experience over time in LBAGs. PLACE consists of 6 design principles: start small and scale up the fidelity, treat participants as co-designers, test in a representative space, focus on activities more than interfaces, respect authentic social experience, and represent time authentically. The effectiveness of PLACE was evaluated by prototyping Floracaching, a geocaching game for citizen science. This revealed the types of insights that PLACE provides, best practices for implementing PLACE, and how PLACE com-pares to other prototyping methods.","citation":[{"content":"Anne Bowser , Derek Hansen , Jennifer Preece , Yurong He , Carol Boston , Jen Hammock, Gamifying citizen science: a study of two user groups, Proceedings of the companion publication of the 17th ACM conference on Computer supported cooperative work & social computing, February 15-19, 2014, Baltimore, Maryland, USA","paperID":"2556502"},{"content":"Jennifer Preece , Anne Bowser, What HCI can do for citizen science, CHI '14 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 26-May 01, 2014, Toronto, Ontario, Canada","paperID":"2590805"},{"content":"Anne Bowser , Derek Hansen , Yurong He , Carol Boston , Matthew Reid , Logan Gunnell , Jennifer Preece, Using gamification to inspire new citizen science volunteers, Proceedings of the First International Conference on Gameful Design, Research, and Applications, p.18-25, October 02-04, 2013, Toronto, Ontario, Canada","paperID":"2583011"},{"content":"Andrea Wiggins , Yurong He, Community-based Data Validation Practices in Citizen Science, Proceedings of the 19th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing, February 27-March 02, 2016, San Francisco, California, USA","paperID":"2820063"},{"content":"Daniel Telaar , Antonio Krüger , Johannes Schöning, A large-scale quantitative survey of the german geocaching community in 2007, Advances in Human-Computer Interaction, 2014, p.7-7, January 2014","paperID":"2677193"},{"content":"Ben Bedwell , Peter Slack , Chris Greenhalgh, Learning from the experts: enabling and studying DIY development of location-based visitor experiences, Proceedings of the 2015 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing, September 07-11, 2015, Osaka, Japan","paperID":"2805838"}],"reference":[{"content":"Steve Benford , Gabriella Giannachi , Boriana Koleva , Tom Rodden, From interaction to trajectories: designing coherent journeys through user experiences, Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 04-09, 2009, Boston, MA, USA","paperID":"1518812"},{"content":"Beyer, H., and Holtzblatt K.
