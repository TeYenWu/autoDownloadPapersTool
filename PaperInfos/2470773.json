Other relevant types of interaction include virtual navigation, text entry, and direct manipulation of control widgets. However, most techniques for remotely acquiring targets with high precision have studied remote pointing in isolation, focusing on pointing efficiency and ignoring the need to support these other types of interaction. We investigate high-precision pointing techniques capable of acquiring targets as small as 4 millimeters on a 5.5 meters wide display while leaving up to 93 % of a typical tablet device's screen space available for task-specific widgets. We compare these techniques to state-of-the-art distant pointing techniques and show that two of our techniques, a purely relative one and one that uses head orientation, perform as well or better than the best pointing-only input techniques while using a fraction of the interaction resources.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/rnwlmwld13Q?rel=0","citation":[{"content":"Said Achmiz , Davide Bolchini, NUICursorTools: cursor behaviors for indirect-pointing, Proceedings of the 2014 International Working Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces, May 27-29, 2014, Como, Italy","paperID":"2600044"},{"content":"Faizan Haque , Mathieu Nancel , Daniel Vogel, Myopoint: Pointing and Clicking Using Forearm Mounted Electromyography and Inertial Motion Sensors, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 18-23, 2015, Seoul, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2702133"},{"content":"Mathieu Nancel , Daniel Vogel , Edward Lank, Clutching Is Not (Necessarily) the Enemy, Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 18-23, 2015, Seoul, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2702134"},{"content":"Kelvin Cheng , Dingyun Zhu, Tablet interaction techniques for viewport navigation on large displays, CHI '14 Extended Abstracts on Human Factors in Computing Systems, April 26-May 01, 2014, Toronto, Ontario, Canada","paperID":"2581148"},{"content":"Simon Voelker , Andrii Matviienko , Johannes Schöning , Jan Borchers, Combining Direct and Indirect Touch Input for Interactive Workspaces using Gaze Input, Proceedings of the 3rd ACM Symposium on Spatial User Interaction, August 08-09, 2015, Los Angeles, California, USA","paperID":"2788949"},{"content":"Jérémie Gilliot , Géry Casiez , Nicolas Roussel, Direct and indirect multi-touch interaction on a wall display, Proceedings of the 26th Conference on l'Interaction Homme-Machine, October 28-31, 2014, Villeneuve d'Ascq, France","paperID":"2670445"},{"content":"Mingyu Liu , Mathieu Nancel , Daniel Vogel, Gunslinger: Subtle Arms-down Mid-air Interaction, Proceedings of the 28th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software & Technology, November 08-11, 2015, Daegu, Kyungpook, Republic of Korea","paperID":"2807489"},{"content":"Can Liu , Olivier Chapuis , Michel Beaudouin-Lafon , Eric Lecolinet , Wendy E.
