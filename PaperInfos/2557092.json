We held a workshop with 5 PD patients and 2 carers exploring perceptions of Glass. This was followed by 5-day field trials of Glass with 4 PD patients, where participants wore the device during everyday activities at home and in public. We report generally positive responses to Glass as a device to instil confidence and safety for this potentially vulnerable group. We also raise concerns related to the potential for Glass to reaffirm dependency on others and stigmatise wearers.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/tgESmp-xVkk?rel=0","title":"Exploring the acceptability of google glass as an everyday assistive device for people with parkinson's","filename":"CHI14/p2551","authors":["Roisin McNaney","John Vines","Daniel Roggen","Madeline Balaam","Pengfei Zhang","Ivan Poliakov","Patrick Olivier"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
