This advantage comes at the cost of accuracy, as chord typing over a flat surface has proven to be highly error prone. A misplaced finger on the screen translates into a different or unrecognized character. However, the chord itself gathers information that can be leveraged to improve input performance. We present B#, a novel correction system for multitouch Braille input that uses chords as the atomic unit of information rather than characters. Experimental results on data collected from 11 blind people revealed that B# is effective in correcting errors at character-level, thus providing opportunities for instant corrections of unrecognized chords; and at word-level, where it outperforms a popular spellchecker by providing correct suggestions for 72% of incorrect words (against 38%). We finish with implications for designing chord-based correction system and avenues for future work.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/CfzOiXTR7MY?rel=0","title":"B#: chord-based correction for multitouch braille input","filename":"CHI14/p1705","authors":["Hugo Nicolau","Kyle Montague","Tiago Guerreiro","João Guerreiro","Vicki L.
