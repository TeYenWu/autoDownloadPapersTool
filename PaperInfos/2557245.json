Our approach was motivated by recent efforts in HCI to more closely align the development of interaction design theory to the craft knowledge and experiences of designers themselves. The resulting insights enhance our understanding of design approaches that a diverse group of ARG producers follow to create interactive, participatory narratives. We outline narrative-specific themes to support designers who craft similar interactive experiences.","video":"http://www.youtube.com/embed/GRtembxx_GI?rel=0","title":"Design tactics for authentic interactive fiction: insights from alternate reality game designers","filename":"CHI14/p947","authors":["Elizabeth Bonsignore","Vicki Moulder","Carman Neustaedter","Derek Hansen","Kari Kraus","Allison Druin"],"conference":"CHI '14"}
